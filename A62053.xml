            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note n="*" place="margin">He died <hi>Nov.</hi> 0. 1673. in the 46th year of his Age.</note> and accordingly thou
<pb facs="tcp:53132:5"/> wilt find <hi>the one ſpirit</hi> of the Author in it, and the ſame <hi>holy, lively</hi> way of diſcourſing, which is ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his other Writings, partly <hi>with reſpect to the matter,</hi> which is about the <hi>eternal recompences,</hi> as they are repreſented by our Lord in a <hi>Scheme</hi> or <hi>Draught</hi> of the <hi>laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> We are hedged within the compaſs of our Duty both on the <hi>right hand,</hi> and on the <hi>left;</hi> on the right hand, with the <hi>hopes of a moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed everlaſting Eſtate;</hi> on the left, with the <hi>fears of endleſs and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing Torments:</hi> Reflections on the former are <hi>comfortable;</hi> what is ſweeter than to live in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> and <hi>fore-ſight</hi> of endleſs Glory? But the <hi>conſideration</hi> of the latter is alſo <hi>profitable.</hi> We need many Sermons about Hell, to keep us out of Hell; therefore in this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi>

            <p>There is alſo another thing large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented which is of great uſe, the <hi>hainouſneſs of Sins of Omiſſion.</hi> Sin in the general is <hi>a tranſgreſſion of the Law, 1</hi> Joh. <hi>3.4.</hi> Now the Law may be tranſgreſſed either by <hi>omitting</hi> what is <hi>commanded</hi> as a Duty to God, or by <hi>committing</hi> what is forbidden, when we directly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs an <hi>affirmative Precept,</hi> that is a ſin of <hi>Omiſſion;</hi> but when we do any thing againſt a <hi>negative Precept,</hi> that is a ſin of <hi>Commiſſion;</hi> in both there is <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence <hi>contempt of Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> had not done what God bids him to do, he telleth him, <hi>That Rebellion is as a ſin of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,

The Sun of Proſperity ſhineth, and the Showers of Adverſity fall on both promiſcuouſly. If there be any difference for the better, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on the worſer ſide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.3. to the 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> But there when the laſt Trump ſhall ſound, the living be changed, the dead raiſed, and all ſhall appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, when the Saints ſhall be called, honoured, acquitted, and rewarded; when the Sinner ſhall be arraigned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, condemned, and executed, when the Judge ſhall ſay to the Saints on his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53132:8"/> right hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World:</hi> And to the Sinners on his left hand, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Then men will ſee and ſay, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the Righteous, Surely there is a God that judgeth in the World. Then men ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and diſcern a difference between the Righteous and the Wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In relation to this great and general Judgment, we may conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Efficient or Judge, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. <hi>The Son of man ſhall come in his glory, with all his holy Angels, and ſhall ſit on the Throne of his Glory.</hi> He that was judged by man, ſhall be Judge of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53132:9"/> 
                  <hi>ſhall be raiſed,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.52. Some underſtand the ſound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet Metaphorically, for the Virtue and Power of Chriſt, whereby he ſhall cite and cauſe all the World to appear before him. Others take it literally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as God appeared on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when he gave the Law with the long and loud ſound of a Trumpet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.19. So he will appear at the great Day with the ſound of a Trump, when he comes to reckon with men for the breach of the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.31. <hi>And he ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> gathered their ſolemn Aſſemblies together with the ſound of a Trumpet.</p>
               <p>And God will gather the greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of men that ever was with the ſound of a Trumpet. <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall then ſee all his Children to the hundredth, and thouſandth, and hundred thouſand Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>

               <p n="4">4. The Event or Execution of the Sentence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>And theſe ſhall go into everlasting puniſhment,</hi> (as <hi>Hamans</hi> face
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53132:9"/> was covered when the Sentence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and preſently led forth to Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>and the Righteous into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the Form or Proceſs of this Day, wherein the Text lieth, theſe four particulars are obſervable:
<list>
                     <item>1. The ſeparation of Perſons.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſetting them in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</item>
                     <item>3. The manifeſtation of perſons and things.</item>
                     <item>4. The pronunciation of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſeparation of Perſons. Now the Tares and Wheat grow together, but then they ſhall be parted aſunder, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>And before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shepheard ſeparateth his ſheep from the goats.</hi> Here they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle together in the ſame Houſe and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and Society, but there the Devils Herd of Goats ſhall be by themſelves, and Chriſts Flock by themſelves. The Wicked ſhall be gathered together, and he ſhall bind them in bundles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. and the Godly gathered together.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53132:10"/> The Sinner ſhall have his deſire, not to be troubled with Admonitions or Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the Preciſe; and the Saint ſhall have his Prayer, not to be vexed with the filthy Converſation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>I have not ſate with vain perſons, neither will I go in with Diſſemblers: I have hated the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of evil doers, and will not ſit with the Wicked,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſetting them in their places. Now the vileſt men are exalted, and the moſt virtuous debaſed, but then it ſhall be otherwiſe. <hi>And then he ſhall ſet the Sheep on his right hand, and the Goats on his left,</hi> verſ. 33. Here the Godly are ſet in low places on foot-ſtools, the Wicked in high places, on Thrones: But there the Godly ſhall be honoured, and the Wicked diſgraced. The right hand is a place of the greateſt honour. To ſit at a Kings right hand, is the higheſt Seat next him. To ſit on King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s right hand, was the honour he gave his Mother, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.19. To ſit at the right hand of God, is peculiar to Chriſt, whom he hath honoured and exalted above Principalities and Powers. <hi>To
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53132:10"/> which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, ſit thou on my right hand,</hi> Epheſ. 20.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13. And to ſit on the right hand of Chriſt will be the honour of his Spouſe, his Queen. At thy right hand was the Queen in Gold of <hi>Ophir, Pſal.</hi> 45.9. They who are now placed at the left hand of earthly Princes, will then be placed at the right hand of the King of Kings, of the bleſſed and glorious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate; and they who are now placed at Kings right hands, will be placed at Chriſts left hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The manifeſtation of Perſons and things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Men. All men ſhall then be pellucid and tranſparent as Chriſtal. <hi>We muſt all appear,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 2 Cor. 5.10. <hi>For we muſt all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment Seat of Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> The word ſignifieth a clear and a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manifeſtation. Such a clear mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of men, that every one may ſee into them, what they are, and what they have been; and ſuch a permanent manifeſtation as will laſt for ever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greek <hi>Scholiast,</hi> on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53132:11"/> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.18. Good men ſhall then be manifeſted, their Principles, their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, their Deſigns and Purpoſes, and their uprightneſs in all to their glory and praiſe. They who are now accuſed of Hypocriſie, and Obſtinacy, and Pride, and Peeviſhneſs; becauſe they could not ſwim with the ſtream, nor run with others to the ſame exceſs of riot, will then be manifeſted to be men of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Humility, and to have declined the prophane courſes of others, not out of fooliſh preciſeneſs, or needleſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity, or humourſomeneſs, but out of Conſcience to the Commands of God. Their Faith, and Love, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, will be found to their praiſe, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jeſus; <hi>When Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye appear with him in Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. They who are now deſpiſed, and reproached, and trampled on as the dirt and dung, and filth of the Earth, will then be manifeſted to be Gods Jewels, Chriſts Glory, and the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>When Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, we ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with him in Glory,</hi> Col. 3.4. Then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53132:11"/> there will be a <hi>manifeſtation of the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.19.</p>
               <p>Bad men will then be manifeſted to be the Servants of Unrighteouſneſs, the Children of the Devil, the Slaves and Vaſſals of Corruption, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their glorious Profeſſion, and ſpecious Pretences, to have been but as a painted Sepulchre, gaudy without, and rottenneſs within; or as a curious Chimney-piece, without white and ſhining, but within full of ſoot and blackneſs: <hi>He will bring to light the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of darkneſs, and make manifeſt the thoughts of the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. We read of the appearing of Chriſt at that day, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. He was vail'd, and hid, and obſcured, when on Earth, but then he ſhall be reveal'd and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the whole World. <hi>When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.7. And it will be a glorious Revelation. <hi>Looking for the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Christ,</hi> Tit. 2.13.</p>
               <p>In this World he appeared as the Son of man, as one born of a Woman, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53132:12"/> in the form of a Servant; but then he ſhall appear as the Son of God, as the only begotten of the Father, and as the Head of Principalities and Powers, and as the Heir of all things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.27. <hi>For the Son of Man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels: and then he ſhall reward every man according to his works. He ſhall come in the Glory of his Father;</hi> i. e. in that Glory and Honour which is proper and peculiar to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</p>
               <p>At his firſt appearing a weak mortal man was his Harbinger,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.3, 4.</note> to prepare his way before him; But at his ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, a mighty immortal Arch-Angel ſhall be his fore-runner, and go before him. <hi>For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. At his firſt appearing he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a few poor mean Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but at his ſecond appearing he ſhall be attended <hi>with his mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.7. <hi>With all his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> Matth. 6.27. With the thouſand thouſand that are before him, and the ten thouſand times ten thouſand that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to him.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53132:12"/>
               <p>At his firſt appearing he came as a Servant to miniſter unto others, and to be abaſed; <hi>He came riding upon an Aſſe, Matth.</hi> 20.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28. But at his ſecond appearing he ſhall come in the Clouds of Heaven as his Chariot, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.61. <hi>To be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe.</hi> And then he ſhall appear as a Lord; ſome think it's therefore called <hi>the Lords-day,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.10.</p>
               <p>At his firſt appearing he appeared wholly as a Saviour and Redeemer. When he appeared to the World, the <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> or kindneſs of God to man appeared, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4. <hi>And the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation appeared, Titus</hi> 2.11. But then he ſhall appear as a Judge, full of Fire, and Fury, and Wrath againſt his Enemies. The Kings, and Captains, and Nobles will call to the Rocks to fall on them, and to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to cover them from the wrath of the Lamb, when that great day of his Wrath is come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16, 17.</p>
               <p>At firſt he appeared as a Sinner; <hi>In the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>He was numbred among the Tranſgreſſors:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53132:13"/> The Lord laid on him the inquity of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53.12. He was called <hi>a Samaritan, and one that had a Devil,</hi> Joh. 10. <hi>A Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber, and a Glutton, a Friend of Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners,</hi> Joh. 8.48. Matth. 11.19. A Traytour againſt <hi>Caeſar, Joh.</hi> 19.12. One guilty of Blaſphemy againſt God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.65. A Conjurer, and one in Compact and Covenant with the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. But his ſecond appearing will be without any ſuch likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, or imputation of ſin by God, or reputation of a Sinner among men. <hi>But unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin unto Salvation,</hi> Heb. 9. ult.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There will be at that day a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of things. The Books that are now ſealed up, will then be opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12.</p>
               <p>The Book of the Divine Decrees will then be unclaſped, and the Names writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Lambs Book of Life will then be viſible and legible to all. <hi>And I ſaw the dead ſmall and great ſtand before God, and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life,</hi> Rev. 20.12. All the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53132:13"/> in time will be manifeſt, then will the Divine Purpoſe from eternity, as now the Divine Purpoſe is manifeſt by the Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>The Book of Divine Providences will then be opened, and all the rare curious Contrivances thereof unfolded; the agreement of Providence with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (as well as with the eternal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) will then be apparent. The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the whole World will then be read by the Saints in one entire Volume. Now we ſee a little of Gods Wiſdom, and Power, and Faithfulneſs in one Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a little in another, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in a third; yea, we are ſo blind, and Providences often ſo dark, that through our ignorance and unbelief, God loſeth much of the Glory due to him for them, and we much of the comfort we might receive by them; but then we ſhall with ſtrengthened and enlarged Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings diſcern the whole Series, Method, and Contexture of Divine Providences together, and how by a powerful, wiſe, gracious Government, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and combin'd, and wrought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for our everlaſting good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53132:14"/> 28. It's one thing to ſee a rich piece of Arras, with a curious ſtory wrought in it, by parcels and pieces, and another thing to ſee it all together, hung up, and to be ſeen all at once with one view.</p>
               <p>The Book of Conſcience will then be opened. Though now wicked men blot and blur this Book by their wilful Preſumptuous ſins, that they cannot read it; though they darken their Eyes, and ſtiffen their Wills, and harden their Hearts, and will not read it, yet then they ſhall have the Book of Conſcience repreſenting to them in large, though black, yea bloody Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, all their atheiſtical Impieties, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, Hypocriſies, Blaſphemies, and they ſhall be forced to read them with ſorrow and terror, whether they will or no.</p>

The Lord Chief Juſtice of the World, the Judge of the Quick and Dead is now in all his Robes and Royalty, with millions of glorious Attendants, in the Glory of his Father, with all his holy Angels, ſet on the Bench. The poor Priſoner, whoſe trembling Soul is newly reunited to the loathſome Carkaſſe of his Body, is drag'd to the Bar, awaiting and expecting ſome doleful doom. He is lately come from Hell, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Life on Earth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Sentence; and loath he is to go back to that place of torments, as knowing that the pain of his Body will

And God is Omnipreſent; <hi>Whither ſhall I fly from thy preſence?</hi> Pſal. 139.7. Therefore we muſt know there is a three-fold preſence of God or Chriſt:</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the eſſential preſence of God, as he is infinite in his Being, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in no place, and excluded out of none, ſo none can depart from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.6. <hi>to</hi> 10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Amos</hi> 9.2, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the favourable preſence of God, as he is the Fountain of Life and Love, and the Father of Mercy, and kindneſs, and all good. The former is the preſence of his Being, this of his Bounty. This is as the preſence of the Sun by his heat chearing, and by his light delighting the Creature. His preſence in this ſenſe is the ſubſtance of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; <hi>Fear not, I will be with thee, Iſa.</hi> 43.2, 3, 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.20.

               <p>THis part of the Verſe will afford this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That a great part of wicked mens puniſhment in the other World, will conſiſt in their departure from the preſence of Chriſt; <hi>Then ſhall he ſay to them on his left hand, Depart from me.</hi> They now bid God depart from them, <hi>They ſay unto God, Depart from us,</hi> Job 21.14. But that which is their wiſh here, ſhall be their woe for ever. <hi>And he ſhall ſay unto them, depart from me ye workers of Inquity, I know you not,</hi> Matth. 7.23. The preſence of Chriſt is now their Trouble, but his abſence will then be their Torment. Hence the ſtate of the wicked in the other World is called <hi>utter-darkneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> in Matth. 8.12.</note> Matth. 8.12. <hi>And blackneſs of darkneſs for ever,</hi> Jude, verſ. 13. Becauſe of its ſeparation from Chriſt, who is the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> and the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Joh. 1.9.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53132:19"/> Mal. 4.2. It ſeems an alluſion to them that are fetter'd in dark doleful dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to thoſe that in the night-time ſtand without in the dark, being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch Rooms as are full of Lights, wherein are rare and coſtly Feaſts.</p>
               <p>In the explication of this Doctrine, I ſhall deſcribe the puniſhment of the wicked: 1. In the perfection of the Object, from which they muſt depart. 2. In the properties of their departure, and then give the Reaſons of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As for the Object of their loſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They loſe <hi>the Lord Jeſus Christ, the Prince of Life, the Lord of Glory, the fairest of ten thouſand, the only begotten of the Father, and the Heir of all things.</hi> The better the Object is, the greater their loſs who are deprived of it. The more excellent the Perſon of Chriſt is, the more exquiſite their puniſhment will be who muſt depart from him. Chriſt is the higheſt, the greateſt, the chiefeſt good. In loſing him,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They depart from an univerſal good, one that is Bread, Water, Light, Life, Reſt, Health, Eaſe, Wine, Marrow,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53132:20"/> a Feaſt, a Friend, a Father, Pardon, Peace, Love, Grace, Glory, any thing, every thing, all things that the Soul wanteth, and requireth to its perfect Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They depart from a ſuitable good, that very ſavoury meat which the Soul loveth and needeth. They loſe that good which the Soul ſhould have, and would have, and muſt have, if ever it be happy. The Soul is guilty, and Chriſt is pardon, pardon is ſuitable to a guilty Soul, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> The Soul is poor, and Chriſt is riches; Riches are ſuitable to a poor Creature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. <hi>The unſearchable Riches of Chriſt:</hi> Prov. 8.18. <hi>Riches and Honour are with me, yea durable Riches and Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Soul is miſerable, naked, filthy, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Death and Wrath, but Chriſt is Mercy, Raiment, cleanſing, freedom from Hell, and the Heaven of Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Rom.</hi> 8.1. He is a good that doth exactly, directly ſuit the condition of the Soul, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Soul, and the neceſſities of the Soul. He is the Plaiſter that fits the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53132:20"/> Sores, and the Balm that hits the wounds of the Soul; when Creatures are Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Phyſick of no value.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They depart from an eternal Good, they loſe that Good which doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuit the Souls diſpoſition, but alſo its duration, that will laſt and abide, and continue for ever. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. <hi>He is everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> Dan. 9.24. <hi>Everlaſting meat,</hi> Joh. 6.27. <hi>Eternal life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. ult.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They depart from, with Chriſt, the Society of all Chriſtians: When they depart from the Head, they depart from the Members. When they depart from the Root, they depart from the Branches. For Head and Members, Root and Branches, muſt be together for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2, 3. <hi>Where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> Now the Sheep and Goats flock together, but then they ſhall be parted aſunder, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>And I ſay unto you, that many ſhall come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſet down with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven: But the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53132:21"/> out into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> They who are now the Objects of their Contempt, will then be the Objects of their envy. When once they loſe the ſight, they ſhall loſe the ſight of thoſe glorious Stars for ever. Every Saint may then ſay to the Sinner (who now frets and fumes at the Saints preſence, becauſe of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs) as <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Pharoah, I will ſee thy face no more,</hi> Matth. 25. ult.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſhall depart, when from Chriſt, from all the means of Grace, or Communion with God. They ſhall hear no more Sermons, and joyn in no more Prayers, and receive no more tenders of Grace, or intreaties of the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.11. <hi>I ſaid, I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the Land of the living: I ſhall behold man no more with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the world.</hi> Where the King is, there he hath his Secretaries, and Seals, and Miniſters of State; and they who are baniſhed the Court, are baniſhed from theſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſhall depart from all the good things of this Life. Each Country hath its proper peculiar Commodities, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53132:21"/> ſo hath each World. This World hath its peculiar good things, ſuch as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this, and not to be found in the other World; therefore the Apoſtle calls them <hi>this worlds goods: He that hath this worlds goods,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.17. So the other World hath its proper peculiar Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, ſuch as are to be found no where elſe. The bleſſings of this are not to be look'd for in the other Life, <hi>There is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage, but all are as Angels.</hi> Good men, as good Angels, above all bodily and temporal Bleſſings; and evil Men, as evil Angels, without them, and fixed in a ſtate of endleſs miſery. The wicked man poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was honourable, but his glory doth not follow after him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.17. He was rich, but that was only in this world, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. He was one that abounded in Pleaſures, but now they are gone and exchanged for pains, <hi>James</hi> 5.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. <hi>But</hi> Abraham <hi>ſaid, Son, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> The Sinner ſhall bid adieu to Temporal good, Spiritual good,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53132:22"/> Eternal good, all good, that he may ſpeak indefinitely, what <hi>Job</hi> ſuppoſing himſelf dying, ſpake reſtrictively, <hi>Mine eye ſhall no more ſee good,</hi> Job 7.7.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Properties of the Sinners loſs.</head>
               <p>Secondly, I Shall ſpeak to the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this departure from Chriſt, or loſs therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſpiritual. It is a loſs peculiar to the Soul or Spirit of Man, and a loſs of that good that is moſt ſuitable to the Soul or Spirit of Man. No mercies are like Soul-mercies, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. and <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. No miſeries are like Soul-miſeries. For the nobler any Being is, the better that is which advantageth it, and the worſe that is that injureth it. It's one thing to relieve or abuſe a diſtreſſed Prince, and another thing to relieve or abuſe a diſtreſſed Subject. The Soul of man is the Prince, the chief and nobleſt part of man, and it is principally the ſubject (as chiefly ſenſible) of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53132:22"/> It's true, the Soul cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God locally, but it can and doth morally here, in its affections and converſation; But that which is now its practice and pleaſure, will then be their torment and puniſhment. Other loſſes pinch the Fleſh, but this pierceth the Spirit. Other loſſes are caſtigatory, and the portion of Children; but this is damnatory, and the portion of Devils. Ah how will the Soul pine and wither away, when it ſhall take its farewel of that Sun, who alone could revive and refreſh it? What a diſmal, doleful death muſt it undergo, when it ſhall depart from him, who is its only Life? <hi>Such a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> The Soul hath more exquiſite ſenſe, and more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious feeling than the Body; therefore its loſs of its own peculiar ſuitable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying good will cut deep, and fill it with bitter horrour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be a total departure. Here they depart in part from God, but then totally. Here <hi>Cain</hi> complains, if not allowed God's preſence in Ordinances, though he had his preſence in many ways of ordinary Favour; <hi>Behold, thou
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53132:23"/> hast driven me this day from the face of the Earth, and from thy face ſhall I be hid,</hi> Gen. 4.14. But alas how doth he complain there? where he is wholly deprived of the Divine preſence in any way of Favour; where he hath not the leaſt glimpſe of the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The partial departures of God have forced ſad Complaints from them that are godly, <hi>Job</hi> 13.24. <hi>Why hideſt thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> I can bear the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings of men, and their abſence: I can bear the ſtrangeneſs of my Friends, and the unkindneſs of Relations, but I cannot bear thy ſtrangeneſs to me, thy with-drawings from me? <hi>Why hideſt thou thy face? Job</hi> though a ſtrong ſtout man, able to overcome the ſtrong One, the Devil; yet was ready to faint away and die at this. <hi>David</hi> crieth out mournfully at it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Why ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou afar off, O Lord? why hidest thou thy ſelf in time of trouble.</hi> Poor <hi>Heman</hi> is diſtracted, and almoſt dead with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.14, 15. <hi>Lord, why hideſt thou thy face? I am afflicted and ready to die: while I ſuffer thy terrors, I am diſtracted.</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53132:23"/> If theſe partial departures, which had much love in them, and with them, caſt down the Friends of God ſo heavily, O what will his total departures out of pure Wrath cauſe to his Enemies. That world muſt needs be doleſome and darkſome indeed, to whom this Sun is wholly ſet, and totally ecclipſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. It will be an eternal departure. They muſt leave God for ever; though it had been ſpiritual and total, yet if but temporal, there had been ſomewhat to have allay'd their Sorrows; but to ſuffer ſo great a loſs, and that wholly, and for ever too, muſt needs pierce to the quick. The Sinner ſhall ſee the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus no more for ever. He muſt depart from the tendereſt Father, loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Friend, richeſt Treaſure, choiceſt Good, greateſt Glory, ſweeteſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that for ever, <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>To whom is reſerved blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.</hi> The Sentence one denounced, <hi>Depart from me,</hi> will be like the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which cannot be altered: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Who ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with everlasting deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> The Anchor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53132:24"/> of Hope will then be broken, the Bridge of Grace will then be drawn, the Gate of Mercy will then be ſhut, and the Gulph between Chriſt and the Wicked never to be paſſed over. They may cry out in truth, what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in unbelief, <hi>Will the Lord cast off for ever? will he be favourable no more? Is is mercy clean gone for ever?</hi> Pſal. 77.7, 8. Alas, they are caſt off for ever, he will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them no more. They may roar out in vain, <hi>How long wilt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get me, O Lord, ſhall I never me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred?</hi> Pſal. 13.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is an irreparable loſs, ſuch a loſs as nothing can make up. There are many good things which we may do well without, becauſe the want of them may be ſupplied by other things. But Chriſt is the one thing neceſſary, the one thing excellent; the want of whom no good thing in Heaven or Earth can make up. When the Soul departs from Chriſt, it departs from all good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing is good without him, and nothing can be had in the room of him. If ſome kind of Food be wanting, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind may poſſibly do as well; ſo

He is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and indeed the only Saviour, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. He is the Mediator between a Righteous God and a guilty Creature, and indeed the only Mediator, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>For there is one God, and one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The reaſons of the Sinners privative Puniſhment.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, I Proceed to the Reaſons of this Doctrine, and ſhall name but two:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wicked men in the other world ſhall be ſentenced to depart from Chriſt, becauſe of their wickedneſs or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of his preſence. The Judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives this Reaſon in the Text, <hi>verſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53132:25"/> 42, 43. <hi>For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat,</hi> &amp;c. Sin is the great Wall of Partition between God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <hi>Evil cannot ſtand in thy ſight, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther canſt thou behold the works of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Pſal. 5. They muſt loſe the light of his Countenance, who never minded the light of his Commandments; the holy Jeſus cannot abide the Company of unholy Creatures. <hi>Shall the Throne of Iniquity have fellowſhip with thee?</hi> No, it may not, it cannot, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.20. It's contrary to his Honour, who hath threatned their baniſhment from him; and it's contrary to his Nature, who hates their Company.</p>
               <p>If God depart from his own people in this world in part, and for a time, it is for their ſins. Your Iniquities ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and your Souls, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. Thus they are the Cloud that interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.22.</note> and hinder the light of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from ſhining on us. <hi>Job</hi> knew and acknowledged this, in <hi>Job</hi> 13.24, 25, 26. <hi>Why hideſt thou thy Face? Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the ſins of my youth.</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:53132:25"/> And if wicked men depart totally and eternally from God in the other World, it is for their ſins. <hi>Depart from me ye Workers of Iniquity, I know you not,</hi> Matth. 7.23. Luke 13.27. Departure from Chriſt is the Wages which the Workers of Iniquity earn. Deeds of darkneſs merit utter darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Wicked men now deſire Chriſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them. <hi>They beſought him to depart out of their Coaſts,</hi> Matth. 8. ult. But what is now their Pleaſure, ſhall then be their Puniſhment. He will go from them, who bid him be gone; and hide his Face for ever from thoſe who turn their backs upon him in time. He that prepares for Sinners the Torments of Hell, will not beſtow on them the Joys of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe of their unfitneſs for the preſence of Chriſt. A carnal heart cannot ſavour a ſpiritual Heaven. The vitiated nature of man cares not for the pleaſures joyn'd with the holineſs of the Coeleſtial Paradiſe. <hi>When Angels kept not their firſt Eſtate, they left their own Habitation,</hi> Jude, verſ. 6. As ſoon as they loſt their primitive Purity, they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53132:26"/> loſt the place of their Glory and Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When once they turn'd haters of God and Holineſs, of their own accord they forſook Heaven. Diſtemper'd Palats cannot relliſh the choiceſt Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. How can the wicked delight in God (which is the Heaven of Heaven) who have in them a predominant enmity againſt him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Follow after holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> It's holineſs that makes the Soul ſit and meet for Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> The Blind are as capable of ſeeing, and the Deaf of hearing, and the Dead of eating and drinking, as wicked men are of ſeeing God as he is, and hearing the melodious Songs of Saints and Angels, and of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tree of Life that groweth in the midſt of Paradiſe, and of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the pure Water that floweth from the Throne of God and the Lamb. If the Tabernacle on Earth, wherein are the Saints of God, and holy Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and the Divine Worſhip, for four or five hours in a week, be a Priſon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53132:26"/> to earthly carnal men, ſurely the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Heaven, wherein is the holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the greateſt manifeſtion of his holineſs, holy Angels, perfect Spirits, pure Service of the bleſſed God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption or ceſſation, would be a Purgatory, yea an Hell to them. Communion with God is impoſſible <hi>(in natura rei)</hi> without conformity to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. They tell a broad lye, who ſay, <hi>They have fellowſhip with God here, and walk after their own luſts,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo to walk even as he walked.</hi> Our delight in God is ever proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our deſires of him. Now wicked men deſiring above all things the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yea the dethroning of God; can never take any delight in his preſence, though they ſhould be admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>If ſuitableneſs be wanting, that which is never ſo excellent is no way joyous or pleaſant to us. All Creatures delight only in what is ſuitable to their natures. <hi>Barzillai</hi> refuſed the pleaſures of <hi>Davids</hi> Court, becauſe they were ſo unſuitable to an old man, that they would be no
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53132:27"/> pleaſures to him; he could not taſt their Meat, nor hear their Muſick. So all the delights of the Coeleſtial Court would be no delights (becauſe of their unſuitableneſs) to ſinful ſenſual natures. Ungodly men could not relliſh the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Dainties at the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb, nor hear with pleaſure the heavenly Quire ſinging the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb. I grant that wicked men are naturally capable of Heaven, as they are rational Creatures; but they are morally uncapable, as they are predominantly carnal and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſo they want that holineſs which ſhould prepare, and diſpoſe, and fit them for Heaven.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes concerning the hainous nature of Sin, and grievous miſery of Sinners.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> I Shall now apply this Doctrine. It may be uſeful by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and by way of Exhortation: 1. By way of Information.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53132:27"/>1. It may inform us. If the Wicked in the other World ſhall be baniſhed the preſence of Chriſt, then how hainous is the nature of Sin, and how odious to God? God is love it ſelf, and delights in Mercy; yea, takes pleaſure in the Proſperity of men; <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi> Micah 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, who pardoneth Iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the Remnant of his Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be ſome grievous Crime, and ſomewhat which is very offenſive to him, that provokes him to ſentence them to an eternal baniſhment from him. O how horrid a thing is Sin? It brings all evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8. And deprives of all good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. Its formal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a voluntary departure from Gods Precepts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. And its woful Effect is an eternal total departure from his gracious preſence. His partial temporary departure from his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (who are the Objects of his eternal Choice, and infinite Love) <hi>which makes them go mourning all the day, and lie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53132:28"/> roaring all the night, becauſe of their ſins,</hi> ſpeaks much of the evil of ſin, but his full everlaſting departure from others, which leaves them naked and ſtript of all Comfort, and expoſed to all Miſery and Miſchief, doth more abundantly proclaim its filthineſs and loathſomeneſs. It can be no ordinary Cloud or Vapour that can obſcure the Sun at noon-day, in all his beauty and brightneſs, and turn the clear day into a black night. And it can be no little or ſmall thing which provokes <hi>the Father of Mercy, and God of all Grace</hi> to deal ſo ſeverely with the works of his own hands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It informs us of the unconceivable miſery of Sinners; They muſt depart from Chriſt for ever. To depart for ever from loving and lovely Relations, is no mean miſery to them who have no other Kindred than thoſe on Earth. It was no ſmall trial of <hi>Abraham</hi> to leave his Kindred and Fathers houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. To depart for ever from dear and intimate Friends, is a ſore trouble to him whoſe heart is knit to them. The failure and diſtance of Friends was grievous to <hi>Job, Job</hi> 19.13, 14. And <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 38.11.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53132:28"/> To depart for ever from all the Saints, the Children of the moſt high, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of the Earth, from the Members of Chriſt, of whom the World is not worthy, will cut deep in them who have any eyes to ſee the amiableneſs of their Perſons, and any hearts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the benefit of their Prayers and Patterns: But to depart for ever from Chriſt, the Prince of Life, the Lord of Glory, the Heir of all things; the richeſt Treaſure, and higheſt Honour, and ſweeteſt Pleaſure, is doleful and dreadful indeed. How may the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cry out, Ah whither do we go now we are going from thee, <hi>thou hast the words of eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſence of Chriſt is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul on Earth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7. <hi>I will ſee you, and your hearts ſhall rejoyce.</hi> Joh. 16.22. <hi>And ye now therefore have ſorrow: but I will ſee you again, and your hearts ſhall rejoyce, and your joy no man taketh from you.</hi> No ſuch hearty comfort, as in the gracious preſence of Chriſt. And the preſence of Chriſt, is the happineſs of the Soul in Heaven. <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved</hi> (though death ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53132:29"/> be not deſirable) <hi>and to be with Chriſt. Finis conciliat mediis amorem.</hi> His preſence is the Heaven of Heavens. It's the excellency of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>there the Tabernacle of God is with men,</hi> and God himſelf ſhall be with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. And the felicity of the Citizens there. They ſhall ſee his Face, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4. In the preſence of Chriſt is all good, and in the abſence of Chriſt is all evil. If it were death to <hi>Abſolom</hi> not to ſee the Kings face, what death will it be to the damned, to be denied for ever the bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight of the face of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If God depart from his people in ſome degrees, (for he is their God ſtill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.1.) and but for a time; as a loving Father, to make his Children more ſenſible of their folly, and of the worth of his Favour; How ſadly have they cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> How horribly will they ſcreech and roar, from whom he departs wholly and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as a ſupream and righteous Judge.</p>
               <p>It will greatly aggravate their miſery, to conſider theſe particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:53132:29"/>1. The greatneſs of their loſs. It's not the loſs of an Houſe, or Eſtate, or bodily good, but the loſs of a Soul, the loſs of a Saviour, the loſs of a God; yea the loſs of all good, and that for ever. It's ſuch a loſs as never had its fellow or equal: It's ſuch a loſs as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit of any addition to it. It's a loſs that never had the like before it, nor ſhall have the like after it. It's an incomparable loſs, that the damned may ſay as he, <hi>Ye have taken away my God, and what have I more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For how ſmall a thing they loſe the bleſſed Jeſus. If they had loſt Chriſt for ſomewhat which might have countervail'd the want of him, or had in any degree equal'd him, it had been the better; but to loſe a God, a Chriſt, a Soul, fulneſs of Joy, for a little aiery Honour, or bruitiſh Pleaſure; this will cut to the heart. O how will it wound the Soul in the other World to think, for how ſmall a toy, for how pitiful a trifle, have I loſt a Crown of Glory, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Pleaſures for ever! Ah what a Fool have I been to loſe Subſtance for Shadows, Bread for Husks, a Fountain
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53132:30"/> of living Waters for broken Ciſterns, their own Mercies for lying Vanities, Chriſtal ſtreams for puddle Water, the choice Dainties of Gods Houſe for the Devils ſcraps, Heaven for Earth, and all things for nothing! Was any in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> ever half ſo diſtracted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will much aggravate their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to conſider, that it was their own voluntary act to loſe ſo much for ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. They ſhall then think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that this woful condition in which they are, was their own choice. All the power and policy of Earth and Hell could not force them to deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Cords that bind them were of their own twiſting, the Rods that ſcourge them were gather'd with their own hands. The Web in which they are caught, and kill'd, was ſpun out of their bowels. God may ſay to them, as once to <hi>Iſrael, Ye have deſtroyed your ſelves,</hi> Hoſ. 13. Ye are your own Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers. I put your Salvation ſo far into your own hands, that ye could not be damned againſt your wills. <hi>Your own Iniquities correct you, and ye are holden with cords of your own ſins,</hi> Prov. 5.22.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53132:30"/> Jer. 4.18. <hi>Thy way and thy doings have procured theſe things unto thee; this is thy wickedneſs, becauſe it is bitter, becauſe it reacheth unto thine heart.</hi> Jer. 2.19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy back-ſlidings ſhall reprove thee: know therefore and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It will exceedingly increaſe their anguiſh, to know perfectly the greatneſs of their loſs. Here they know not the worth of a Chriſt; and thence they are little troubled at the want of Chriſt, but then their eyes ſhall be opened to ſee the Beauty, Excellency, and Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of him whom they have loſt, and to ſee the coſtly Delicacies, choice Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, pure and perfect Pleaſures which the Godly enjoy in him, and with him; and ſo by the increaſe of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will be an increaſe of their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. They ſhall ſee <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven, they ſhall ſee their Neighbours whom they ſcorned and mocked, for their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and preciſeneſs in the preſence of Chriſt, in the Arms and embraces of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53132:31"/> Chriſt, in a ſtate of full Happineſs and perfect Satisfaction, while they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſhut out, and denied entrance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.25, 28. The fire of Hell will give them light enough to ſee, as well as heat enough to feel themſelves infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely miſerable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It will greatly add to their torment and anguiſh to conſider, that they were ſometime near the enjoyment of this bliſsful preſence of Chriſt. Pardon, and Peace, and Love, and Life, and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fruition of the bleſſed Jeſus were tendered to them, were nigh them, were at the very door of their hearts. They were ſolemnly commanded, lovingly invited, ſeverely threatned, ſweetly allured, and pathetically perſwaded to accept of Chriſt and Grace; yea, and Heaven, and Happineſs, and eternal Life; yea, and their hearts began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and to cloſe with the intreaties of the Goſpel; They were almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be Chriſtians indeed. There was but a little, a very little between them and Chriſt. The bargain was driven ſo far, that Chriſt was got into their conſciences, they bore witneſs for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53132:31"/> him, and warn'd them, if they loved their Lives, their Souls, to accept of him while he would accept of them; yea, Chriſt was got into their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they gave their Verdict on his ſide, as one infinitely more amiable and elegible than the World or Fleſh; nay, he had poſſibly got into their Affections, they delighted to hear of his great Love to poor Sinners, and of the great things he purchaſed for them with his own blood; and yet though they were ſo near, they came ſhort, and like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> play'd the part of unwiſe Sons, and ſtay'd in the place of the breaking forth of Children.</p>
               <p>O how like a Dagger will it pierce the heart of them that live under the Goſpel, and neglect the great Salvation offer'd to them; when they come to be baniſhed the preſence of Chriſt, and to ſee others, who made Religion their buſineſs on Earth, bathing their Souls in Rivers of Pleaſures, drawing water with joy out of the Well of Salvation, eating of the Tree of Life that groweth in the midſt of Paradiſe, and hous'd in the Arms of their deareſt Saviour,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53132:32"/> and ſhall reflect and conſider with themſelves, all thoſe Joys and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, all thoſe Dainties and Delicacies, all thoſe Robes, and Riches, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Felicities, which they enjoy in the preſence of Chriſt, might have been mine; they were freely, and frequently, and affectionately offered to me, I had the refuſal of them; nay, I had a good mind to them, I was not far from the Kingdom of Heaven. There was but a little between me and them, they were at the very door of my heart, and ſtood knocking there for admiſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only hearty acceptance; but like a Fool I dallied with them, and defer'd them, as if hereafter had been time enough, and ſo have loſt them for ever.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It will much augment their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and miſery to conſider, who it is that paſſeth ſo ſevere a doom upon them. This dreadful Sentence is pronounced by Love, and Grace, and Goodneſs it ſelf. He that ſometimes call'd them to him ſo ſweetly, ſo affectionately, now caſts them from him ſo ſharply, ſo furiouſly. He who ſometimes cry'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53132:32"/> to them, <hi>Come to me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden;</hi> and wept over them, <hi>O that thou hadſt known, even thou in this thy day, the things of thy peace.</hi> He that formerly invited, intreated, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought them to be reconciled,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and ſhew'd them his heart-blood, the price of their Pardon and Life, and ſtretch'd out his Arms to imbrace their returning Souls, will now in wrath, and rage, and flames, and fury, bid them be gone from him, and his Curſe go along with them. And if Love prove their Enemy, ſurely Wrath will not be their Friend. And if Mercy be thus againſt them, ſurely Juſtice will not be for them. Ah how ſorely will it gall the Sinner to conſider, This dreadful doom is denounced againſt me not by an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or one that hated me, but by a Friend and Father, by one that loved me, and took my nature on him, and ſuffered therein the Laws Curſe, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me capable of eſcaping theſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I now ſuffer, and partaking of thoſe Pleaſures which yonder bleſſed Souls enjoy.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Containing the folly of Sinners, and the vaſt difference between them and the Godly at the Great day.</head>
               <p n="3">3. IT informeth us that every wicked man is out of his wits; ſurely the man is mad, who exchangeth his Soul, and Saviour, and God, and all for a little worldly profit, or fleſhly pleaſure; yea, that parts with true and durable Riches, for ſhadowy and fading Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that loſeth heavenly and eternal Joys, for earthly and tranſitory Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>No man can love ſin, but he hates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; nor part with his Duty, but he parts with his Felicity. And ſurely ſuch a man who hates himſelf, and forſakes his Happineſs, is a mad man. Well might the Holy Ghoſt ſpeak the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal out of his wits, when he was out of his way, and wandring from his Father's houſe. How mad was he to forſake Bread for Husks? (all the world is but Huſks, dry, coorſe, empty Fare, to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53132:33"/> Dainties of the Goſpel.) Bread in a Fathers houſe, for Huſks among Swine; yea, and plenty of Bread, enough and to ſpare, for a few Huſks that could not fill their Bellies.</p>
               <p>If one Soul be more worth than a whole World, ſurely one Saviour, one God is more worth than a thouſand Souls, than a million of Worlds. How mad then is he that parts with this Soul, this Saviour, this God, for a little, a very little of this World; yea, for this little of the World for a very little time.</p>
               <p>If all the delights of the Fleſh, and all the Pleaſures of Sin, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the World, cannot ballance the partial enjoyment of God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for one hour; How unable will they be to compenſate the loſs of full Communion with God for ever? O how infinitely doth Chriſt out-weigh what ever the fleſh or world can offer in exchange for him!</p>
               <p n="4">4. It informeth how contrary the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Godly and the Wicked is at the day of Judgment. At this day they fare often alike, they fall under the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53132:34"/> ſame favourable and frowning Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, they have the ſame Comforts, and the ſame Croſſes. If any difference for the better, 'tis uſually on the Sinners ſide. <hi>The vileſt men are exalted, and the proud proſper.</hi> But at that day there will be a difference indeed for the better on the Saints ſide. That day will be terrible to the Wicked, a day of wrath, a day of the perdition of ungodly men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. To the Godly a day of Redemption, a time of refreſhing, a day of Light and Gladneſs, and a good day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference between the Godly and the Wicked at that day will be vaſt.</p>

               <p n="2">2. In regard of the Sentence. And indeed herein is the principal difference. God and the Devil, Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Heaven and Hell, are not more contrary than the doom of the Godly and Wicked at the great day.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> An uſe of Trial, with the marks of thoſe that ſhall be baniſhed Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</head>
               <p>Secondly, THis Doctrine may be uſeful by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and that two ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To try whether thou, <hi>Reader,</hi> art one of them that art like to be baniſhed the preſence of Chriſt. It's a woful doom, as thou haſt heard at large; therefore examine thy ſelf, whether it ſhall be thy part and portion or no? To help thee herein, that thou mayſt not deceive and delude thy own Soul, I ſhall give thee out of the Word of Truth, the Characters of them, to whom Chriſt will ſay, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The evil Liver and prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall be baniſhed Chriſts preſence. The black Sinner ſhall not ſtand before the white Throne. <hi>Then ſhall he ſay unto them, Depart from me ye Workers of Iniquity, I know you not,</hi> Matth. 7.23, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.27. Thoſe who lived in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53132:37"/> breach of his Commands, muſt not live in the enjoyment of his company. The Workers of Iniquity muſt aſſociate with the wicked One, not with the holy One. Heaven can by no means admit the unholy; <hi>Into it can in no wiſe enter any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination,</hi> Rev. 21. ult. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Sinners proclaim to the World, That the Devil, not Chriſt, is their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that Hell where the Devil is with his Angels, not Heaven where Chriſt is with his Angels ſhall be their eternal home. They who never liked or loved his preſence on the Earth, but baniſhed him their Hearts and Houſes, muſt think and expect that he will not like or love their preſence, but ſentence them to an everlaſting baniſhment from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The groſly ignorant Creature ſhall be baniſhed the preſence of Chriſt. He will not know them who do not know him. Wilful Ignorance doth certainly exclude the undefiled Inheritance. A blind eye cannot ſee the bleſſed Jeſus in all his Glory; neither can a dark Heart enjoy the Kingdom of Light.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53132:38"/> 
                  <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his mighty Angels, to render Vengeance on them that know not God,</hi> (2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8.) <hi>Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlasting deſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord.</hi> The portion of ſuch will be everlaſting deſtruction from his preſence. <hi>They are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge, becauſe they reject knowledge;</hi> Chriſt will reject them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. They are loſt Souls, whoſe eyes the God of this World hath blinded, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner darkneſs is the direct way to <hi>utter darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The hypocritical Profeſſor ſhall be excluded the preſence of Chriſt. He that hath but the ſhadow of Holineſs, muſt expect a real Hell. If thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Name of Chriſt, and art not partaker of the Divine Nature, thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> Letter to <hi>Joab</hi>) will but haſten thy Execution, <hi>Job</hi> 13.16. <hi>He</hi> (i. e. God) <hi>alſo ſhall be my Salvation, but an Hypocrite ſhall not come before him.</hi> God will be the godly upright Souls Salvation, but not the Hypocrites. <hi>He ſhall not dwell with God, Pſal.</hi> 5.4. No, not ſtand in his ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. Nay,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53132:38"/> not ſo much as come before him with any Comfort. He may come before good men with acceptance, as the fooliſh Virgins before the wiſe, who were ignorant of their Hypocriſie, but he ſhall not come before the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient God. When thoſe Virgins came which wanted Oil, the door was ſhut, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. There was no entrance, no admiſſion for them. They had not received God into their Hearts (though he was often in their Lips) and he would not receive them into his Houſe; <hi>The door was ſhut.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> An Exhortation to flie from this wrath to come; with ſome helps thereunto.</head>
               <p n="2">2. IT may exhort us to take heed, that this ſeparation from Chriſt be not our portion. O, <hi>Reader,</hi> how much doth it concern thee, what-ever thou loſeſt, to make ſure of the preſence of Chriſt in the other World! Believe it, though thou canſt bear the loſs of an
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53132:39"/> Eſtate, or Friends, or Relations; yea, and the partial abſence of Chriſt in this World, yet the total loſs of Chriſt in the other World will be an intollerable loſs. They who live here chearfully without him, cannot do ſo there. When thou ſhalt be baniſhed from all thy Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and all thy Relations, and all thy worldly Comforts, then alſo to be baniſhed from Chriſt, the Prince of Life, and Lord of Glory, and Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will be a woe with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Canſt thou read and hear the miſery of the wicked, in their total, eternal ſeparation from Chriſt, and not tremble, for fear it ſhould be thy portion, leſt thou ſhouldſt be of the number of them that ſhall hear that dreadful Voice, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this end, that thou mayſt eſcape this woful Condition of the Ungodly, obey theſe few Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Believe and bewail your enmity againſt Chriſt. He loves you, yet by nature thou hateſt him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. Indeed he may ſay of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53132:39"/> thee, and all others in thy Condition, <hi>They hated me without a cauſe.</hi> But thou doſt hate him, and thereby art wholly uncapable of his preſence. <hi>Can two walk together unleſs they be agreed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This enmity of thine againſt Chriſt (which diſcovers it ſelf in thy daily Rebellions againſt his Laws, and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his Authority,) muſt be felt and lamented. There is little hope of their recovery, who are ſick unto death, and inſenſible thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12. —<hi>They that be whole need not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, but they that are ſick.</hi> Thy firſt work muſt be to know this plague of thine own heart; and to know it not notionally, as a Phyſician, by reading of it, or beholding it in others; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally, as the Patient knoweth a Diſeaſe by feeling it, complaining of it, mourning for it, and longing to be freed from it.</p>
               <p>Conſider with thy ſelf how impoſſible it is for thee to delight in the preſence of Chriſt, whom thou abhorreſt; and to take pleaſure in the Company of any, whom thy nature hath a reluctancy againſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53132:40"/>2. Make Chriſt your Friend through Faith in his blood. There is no getting to Chriſt hereafter, but by coming to him here. Accept him now, and he will accept thee then. He will ſay to thoſe that are now ſtrangers to him, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, I never knew you.</hi> If thou doſt not know him, and him crucified in this World, he will not know thee in the other World. Thou canſt not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally expect admiſſion into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, if thou haſt no acquaintance with his perſon. Strangers and Enemies are kept out, when Children, and thoſe that are the Friends of the Maſter of the houſe are taken in. It is by Faith in his blood that thou canſt be united to him, and made one with him; as the Wife is united to the Husband, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the Head, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. <hi>That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church.</hi> Epheſ. 1. ult. <hi>Which is the Body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all. Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. And being ſo made one with him, Huſband and Wife, Head and Members ſhall be together for ever. <hi>Where I am, there ſhall ye be alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.2, 3. The great ground of Chriſts paſſion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53132:40"/> was, to bring thoſe that believe to God, and that they might abide with him eternally.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Follow after holineſs. The holy Soul can only ſuit an holy Saviour, and therefore the holy Soul can only enjoy the holy Saviour. Two cannot walk comfortably together, unleſs there be an agreement in their diſpoſitions. <hi>Into the new</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>can in no wiſe enter any thing that defileth, or is unclean,</hi> Rev. 21. ult.</p>
               <p>Heaven is an holy Hill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.1. An undefiled Inheritance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. The holieſt or moſt holy place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8, 12. And therefore will admit of none but holy perſons. Dogs muſt be without, when Children ſhall be taken within doors.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That the Wicked ſhall in the other world depart from Chriſt, into fire; <hi>Depart from me into everlasting fire.</hi> They ſhall not only be ſtript of all good, <hi>Depart from me;</hi> but alſo be filled with all evil, <hi>Into everlasting fire.</hi> Our Saviour in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.9. calls it <hi>Hell fire.</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt terms it, <hi>The ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the eternal Fire,</hi> Jude, verſ. 7.</p>
               <p>In the Explication of this Doctrine, I ſhall ſhew:

               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:53132:42"/>
               <p>For the former, the puniſhment of the damned reſembleth <hi>Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of its intenſion, and the extream pain and anguiſh it cauſeth. <hi>Fire</hi> is the moſt out-ragious and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of all the Elements. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> thought to fright and fear men to purpoſe, with the threatning of a fiery Furnace. The fire in the Valley of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> wherein Children were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as a Burnt-Offering to the Devil, was exquiſitely tormenting. But who can tell the pains of Hell? Thoſe fires are but dark ſhadows and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this <hi>Fire.</hi> VVhat elementary or culinary fire is comparable to that <hi>Fire. Phaleris</hi> Bull, <hi>Low-country</hi> Racks, <hi>Forreign</hi> Strapadoes, are nothing; not ſo much as Flea-bites to the the fire of Hell.</p>
               <p>The woful effect of it ſpeaks it terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It cauſeth weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> The difference between our fires and Hell fire.</head>
               <p>BUt the great pain of the wicked will more fully appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the difference between our fires on Earth, and that in Hell.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They differ in the cauſe of their kindling. Our fires are kindled with cold Air, a puff of Wind; thus the ſpark is blown up into a flame. <hi>But</hi> Tophet <hi>is prepared of old: for the King it is prepared: the pile thereof is fire and much wood, and the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone, doth kindle it,</hi> Iſa. 30.33. O what a flame is that which is blown up by the breath of an Almighty God. What a vaſt difference is there between the breath of man, or of a pair of Bellows, and the breath of a God? This breath is like a ſtream of brimſtone; and if the breath that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the fire be like a ſtream, or rather a Sea of brimſtone, what is the fire it ſelf? What a vaſt difference is there between
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53132:44"/> the breath of a pair of Bellows, and the fire kindled by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in their nature. Our fires are by Philoſophers deſcribed to be a ſtream of ſulphurous particles, or ſwarm of motes of brimſtone, violently agitated, and forcibly breaking forth from thoſe reſpective Bodies to which they did formerly belong. And this is apparent, becauſe when any body is throughly burnt, the ſulphurious parts are almoſt gone; and when thoſe parts are gone, what remains will burn no longer. But the fire of Hell, whether it be material or metaphorical, is quite another thing. It is a deep impreſſion of infinite wrath and fury on every member of the Body, and faculty of the Soul. <hi>And O what a fearful thing is it to fall into the hands of the living God, for our God is a conſuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12.2. ult. The wrath of God is ſometimes compared to that of a Lion roaring after her prey, which tears, and rents, and kills, and ſlays, without the leaſt pity. And to a Bear robbed of her Whelps, which claws, and wounds, and deſtroys what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes near her. But alas, the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53132:45"/> wrath of a God is infinitely more cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, more killing. The Mountains are moved, the Rocks are rent in pieces, the ſtouteſt Oaks are rooted up, the Foundations of the Earth tremble, the great Luminaries are darkned, the courſe of Nature is over-turned, when he is wroth. <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared, for who may ſtand when thou art angry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If his wrath be kindled but a little, how wofully do his own Children cry out,</hi> Job 6.4. <hi>The Arrows of the Almighty are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me,</hi> Job 13.24. <hi>Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine enemy? Pſal.</hi> 88. <hi>Their Spirits are drunk up, while they ſuffer his terrors, they are diſtracted.</hi> What then will be the condition of them on whom he will pour out all his wrath? If a ſmall degree of God's anger be ſo terrible, when it is mingled with Love; what will a full Cup of pure wrath be?</p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in the ends of their Creation. Our fires were created for our Service and Comfort. God made theſe for the uſe and benefit of man, to fence us againſt the cold; to melt and mould metals, and form them into
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53132:45"/> ſeveral moulds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the fire of Hell is created for the torment of Men and Devils. God makes it of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as may beſt ſuit his end. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe Agent fitteth his means to his end; and the more wiſe the Agent is, the more proper means he findeth out for his end. Now when the only wiſe God, to whom Angels themſelves are Fools, ſhall ſet his infinite Wiſdom awork about the moſt proper means of rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and torturing the poor Creature; ſurely it will be done to purpoſe. As when his Love ſets his Wiſdom awork, to find out a way to comfort his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, what Rivers of Pleaſures, VVeights of Glory, Crowns of Life, fulneſs of Joy doth he provide. So when his wrath ſets VViſdom awork, to find out a way for the afflicting his Enemies, what ſtinging Adders, and gnawing VVorms, and Chains of Darkneſs, and Lakes of Brimſtone doth he provide.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They differ in the Fewel that feeds them. Our fires are maintain'd and preſerv'd in burning by wood or coals, or ſomewhat that is combuſtible; and the fire muſt be ſuitable to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53132:46"/> and limitedneſs of the fewel. But the fire of Hell is fed with the Curſe of a righteous Law, and the wrath of an infinite God, and the luſts of the damned. Ah what work will ſin, back'd with the Curſe and wrath of God, make in the Souls and Bodies of men. If <hi>David</hi> beloved of God under the weight of ſin, and ſenſe of Divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures, went mourning all the day, and cryeth out ſo mounfully, <hi>Thine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſtick faſt in me, and thy hand preſſeth me ſore. There is no ſoundneſs, in my fleſh, becauſe of thine Anger, nor reſt in my bones becauſe of my Sin. Mine Iniquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den they are too heavy for me,</hi> Pſal. 38.2, 3, 4. O what will they ſuffer! and how will they roar and howl, whoſe Sins are as a Mountain of Lead, ſhall preſs and oppreſs their Conſciences! all whoſe luſts ſhall gnaw their Spirits, ſet home and cloſe to their Souls by the fury and malediction of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They differ in this, that our fires are accompanied with Light; but the fire of Hell, though it hath heat to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath no light to comfort. It is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53132:46"/> a ſtate of darkneſs, <hi>of utter darkneſs, Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>Of Blackneſs of Darkneſs,</hi> Jude, verſ. 13. They have only light enough to ſee themſelves endleſly and eaſeleſly wretched and miſerable. Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is dreadful, but what darkneſs like <hi>utter darkneſs,</hi> or <hi>blackneſs of darkneſs?</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> did not move out of their places in the time of their darkneſs, but what will men do in the dark, in the midſt of ravenous VVolves, and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lions, and ſtinging Adders, and fiery Serpents, and frightful Devils?</p>
               <p n="6">6. They differ in their Operations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our fires work only on the Body, they cannot pierce the Soul; but Hell fire pierceth the Soul. Spirits burn in it as well as Bodies, <hi>Go into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> If it ſeiſe on Devils, it will alſo on the Souls of men. The Spirit whoſe ſenſes are moſt acute, will feel the greateſt pain in the unquenchable fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our fires deſtroy and conſume their fewel; they turn their wood and coals into duſt and aſhes; the bodies of men are by them turn'd into aſhes, and hereby the pain ceaſeth with the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53132:47"/> life of the Creature. But the fire of Hell will never conſume, though it be ever conſuming, it will always be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, but never deſtroy the Sinner. The damned will be always dying, but never die. The Almighty hand of God will preſerve them, to undergo that wrath that is intollerable, and thoſe flames that are unquenchable.</p>

They ſhall not only be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all good, in their baniſhment from the preſence of God, but alſo be afflicted with all evil, in their ſuffering the pains of Hell fire. The godly in the other World ſhall be perfectly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in their freedom from all poenal and all moral evil, and their fruition of all that is truly good, <hi>for they ſhall ever
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53132:47"/> be with the Lord,</hi> who is an univerſal good. So the Wicked in the World to come ſhall be perfectly curſed, in the abſence of what ever is comfortable, and in the preſence of whatſoever is dreadful, and may render them miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Snares, Fire, Brimſtone, an horrible Tempeſt, ſhall be rained on them as their portion; woful are the fruits of Sin oftentimes in this World. It keeps good from men here, ſtrips them of their Eſtates, Relations, Liberties, Limbs, Health, Names; nay, of the Goſpel, Ordinances, and ſeaſons of Grace, and brings on them much evil here, Aches, Pains, Diſeaſes in their Bodies, Horrors and Terrors in their Souls. But theſe are nothing to the effects of Sin in the other World. Here in the midſt of Judgment, Mercy is remembred; there is no ſtate on Earth of mear or pure wrath. All good things are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, nor all evil things inflicted on any. In the worſt Eſtate there is Life, and that cloathed with ſome Favours. The pained have ſome intermiſſion, or at leaſt remiſſion of their pains. In the loweſt eſtate there is hope of better,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53132:48"/> and that is no ſmall Cordial to a poor Creature; there is no Condition ſo bad, but might have been worſe, both for its intention and duration. But now in the other World, the wicked have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a mite of Mercy, and Miſery without any Eaſe; either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of degree or intermiſſion: All good baniſhed from them, and all evil inflicted on them.</p>
               <p>Ex. If the wicked ſhall be thus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the loſs of Chriſt, and the pains of Hell fire; it exhorts us to <hi>flee from the wrath to come.</hi> Ah who would fry one hour in flames for a Kingdom! How dreadful is the hearing of fire; fire, in the night? How doth the very ſound of it fright men and women? Ah then what will the feeling of it be in utter darkneſs, in that black long night of eternity! Sinner, when thou art tempted to ſin, conſider whether the ſatisfaction of thy Luſt will make thee amends for, and ballance the loſs of God, and thy ſuffering the flames of Hell.</p>
               <p>Alas, how little is the pleaſure of Sin, but how terrible, how intollerable is the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53132:48"/> pain of it! What wiſe man would be rack'd a day for a moments delight? much leſs ſuffer the wrath of an infinite God, for the dreggy pleaſures of a Beaſt. Doſt thou think thou canſt bear it? art thou able to endure it? Canſt thou ſuffer the pain of our fire? if not, how wilt thou endure the pain of that fire which the breath of a God kindleth, and keepeth burning? which tortures the Soul as well as the Body, and which was prepared of God for the afflicting and puniſhing his Creatures. O Friend, flie to Chriſt, if thou wouldſt <hi>flee from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> He is the only ſkreen between thee and the fire of Hell.

               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. That the puniſhment of the wicked in the other World will be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. It will not only be extream, in regard of its intention; but alſo eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, in regard of its duration. Their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53132:49"/> privative puniſhment will be eternal: <hi>They ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. And ſo will their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive puniſhment be, <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Cities about them are ſet forth, ſuffering the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the eternal fire. And Chriſt tells us, <hi>There the worm never dieth, and the fire never goeth out,</hi> Matth. 18. And again, it's called <hi>the Lake that burns with fire and brimstone for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were no ſmall eaſe to the damned, if they had hopes of any end of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; though after as many millions of millions of years as have been moments ſince the Creation, and as are Creatures ſmall and great in both worlds; but it may not be, it cannot be; after all theſe years they are not to remain one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the leſs in Hell.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only give the Reaſons of it, and proceed to the Uſe.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral Reaſons given why the Sinners temporal fault ſhould have an eternal puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some tell us, He refuſed eternal Life, and therefore it's but reaſon he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53132:50"/> ſhould be puniſhed with eternal death. They had eternal pains and eternal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſet before them, and they choſe eternal pains. In chooſing the way, they choſe the end; they choſe the way of the Fleſh, the way of their own Hearts, and ſo conſequentially they choſe Hell, to which that way led. Now if a man hath but his own choice, whom can he blame but himſelf? If a man have what he deſireth and loveth, if it be ill with him, he muſt thank himſelf. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own Soul: all that hate me, love death,</hi> Prov. 8. ult, Jer. 4.17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others tell us, That if they ſhould live here for ever, they would ſin for ever; therefore God taking the will for the deed, puniſheth them for ever. They die eternally for ſin, who would have lived eternally in ſin. <hi>Vellet ſine fine vivere ut poſſet ſine fine peccare,</hi> Greg. Man would live here for ever, if he had his will, that he might ſin for ever. <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> tell us, <hi>Peccant in aeterno ſuo &amp; puniuntur in aeterno Dei:</hi> They ſin in their eternity, and God puniſheth them in his eternity. If God would
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53132:50"/> give them an eternal abode on Earth, they would imploy it in diſobeying and diſhonouring him eternally. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would ſin for ever, therefore they ſhall ſuffer for ever; <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.5. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſlidden back with a perpetual back-ſliding; <hi>they hold faſt deceit, and refuſe to return.</hi> How loath are they to forſake their Luſts: 1. They hold them faſt. <hi>As a Fountain ſendeth forth water, ſo doth the Sinner ſend forth wickedneſs,</hi> Jer. 6.7. Now a Fountain ſendeth forth water freely without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and conſtantly without ceſſation. What any thing doth naturally, it doth eaſily and unweariedly. The Sun ſhines naturally, and he ſhines without any pains or tireſomeneſs. The Fountain ſends forth water naturally, and doth it with eaſe and conſtancy. So the Sinner ſins naturally, and doth it delightfully and unweariedly. When the Body and its members, the inſtruments of ſin, are tired and worn out, and unable to execute the luſts of the fleſh, the body of ſin is ſtill freſh and vigorous in plotting and conſpiring evil, and in embracing and cheriſhing evil motions: whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53132:51"/> that man ſinning naturally would (if he lived) ſin eternally, and thence ſay they, He is tormented for ever. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The principal Reaſon of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Sinners miſery, and indeed the only reaſon in my Judgment (with due reſpect to others) is the infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of ſin, as committed againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty. Becauſe the Sinner is not capable of bearing a puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in intenſion, therefore he muſt have it infinite in duration. I doubt not, but if the Sinner were able to bear the infinite ſtroak of Divine Juſtice (notwithſtanding his will to ſin for ever, and his choice of eternal death, and all the other reaſons that are uſually brought for the eternity of their pains,) he ſhould not ſtay long in that priſon of Hell, but quickly be releaſed: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a poor finite Creature hath not a back ſtrong enough to bear an infinite blow, therefore he muſt be always ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The notoriety and malignity of ſin proceeds from the dignity of the Perſon againſt whom its committed, as I have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53132:51"/> largely ſhewn elſe-where. Becauſe the Authority of an infinite God is diſpiſed, the Law of an infinite God diſobeyed, the Love of an infinite God undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Image of an infinite God defaced by ſin, therefore there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite demerit in ſin. In a Treatiſe called <hi>The Incomparableneſs of God.</hi> And becauſe man cannot give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction infinite in value, therefore he muſt give that ſatisfaction which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in time, or rather in its eternity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Job</hi> 7.20. And conſidering that God was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have full ſatisfaction for ſin, I conceive Chriſt himſelf could not have ſatisfied for the ſins of any, if he could not have offered a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of infinite merit to anſwer the infinite demerit of ſin. But herein the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God did ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound, in providing an Antidote ſtronger than the Poyſon; for whereas ſin is infinite, only <hi>Objective,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt an infinite God: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie of Chriſt is infinite, both <hi>Objective</hi> and <hi>Subjective,</hi> as offer'd up to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majeſty, and offer'd by one that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53132:52"/> was an infinite Majeſty; whoſe Perſon being infinite, rendred his Sacrifice of ſuch boundleſs value and merit.</p>

Ah how will diſpair, like a dagger, ſtab thee to the heart! what a cutting coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive will it be to think, I am here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt horrid, hideous, helliſh Devils, (who have been my Tempters, and are now my Tormentors,) baniſhed the bliſsful preſence of God and Jeſus
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53132:53"/> Chriſt, ſuffering thoſe torments, and pains, and miſery, to which all the fires and racks on Earth are but as the raſing of ſkin to <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> fiery Furnace. Ah what Tongue can tell what this poor Body ſuffereth in every part of it! Ah what Underſtanding can apprehend the anguiſh and remorſe of this Soul, its cutting Reflections on what it hath been and done, and its kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling praeviſion of what it muſt undergo, and I muſt endure all this for ever! Though my pains are ſo extream in their intention, yet if they were ſhort in their duration, I had ſome ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; nay, if they were to laſt no more millions of years, than there are Stars in Heaven, and drops of water in the Ocean, I ſhould have ſome crevis of light, ſome hope to bear up my heart: But alas, alas, I am here in the midſt of this curſed Crew, under theſe extream ineffable pains, and muſt be here for ever. The wrath upon me is abiding wrath, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> It is wrath to come, and ever will be wrath to come. After Ages, and Generations, and millions of them; I, and millions of millions of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53132:54"/> them, my pain would not be a moment the nearer a period. My night of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and horrour will be along night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Clock will never ſtrike, the time will never paſs, the morn will never dawn, and the Sun will never riſe. O what ſhall I do, thouſands, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of thouſands, millions, and milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of millions, of millions, ſignifie not a moment to my wretched and curſed eternity. Ah ſuch company, ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and that for ever, ever, ever! <hi>Reader,</hi> doth not thy Soul tremble to think of this, which will be the portion (probably) of moſt in the Chriſtian World; and wilt thou give thy ſelf a moments reſt, in a ſtate liable and obnoxious to it: For the ſake of thy precious Soul, if thou haſt any true ſelf-love, <hi>Break off thy ſins by Repentance, and thine Iniquities by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of thy Redeemer.</hi> Hell hath not yet ſhut its mouth upon thee, nor is the gate of Mercy yet ſhut againſt thee.

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> The reaſon of Chriſts ſevere Sentence, and a question reſolved, whether the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, by their Acts of Charity, do not deſerve Heaven as well, as the Wicked, by their Omiſſion thereof, deſerve Hell.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, THe reaſon of Chriſt's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Sentence againſt them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40, 43. <hi>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink. I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not: ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words have nothing of difficulty in them, and therefore I ſhall not waſt time in the explication of them. Every one knows what it is not to give meat to the Hungry, or drink to the Thirſty, or Raiment to the Naked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That it is the omiſſion of a Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which God commands, and alſo that Believers are the Members of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Chriſt myſtical, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. And therefore what injuries are
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53132:55"/> done to them, are done to Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. Only it may be needful to ſpeak to theſe two particulars, before I raiſe the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether there be not the like ground of the Salvation of the bleſſed that there is of the damnation of the wicked; namely, the merit of their works. Both ſeem to ſpeak it, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat.</hi> Again, <hi>Go ye curſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why Chriſt will try men at the great day by the performance or neglect of this Duty of Charity, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their performance or neglect of Prayer, Hearing, Watchfulneſs, or ſome other Duty, or by their Humility, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs, Patience, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. In that Chriſt tells them, <hi>That this Kingdom was prepared for them before the foundation of the World.</hi> Now what could they do before they had a Being to deſerve this Inheritance. And the Apoſtle is poſitive, that all is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Purpoſe of God, not to the piety of any men. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Children being not yet born, neither

               <p>If it be Objected, That God foreſaw that they would improve their Free will unto the performance of ſuch good Works, whereby they would deſerve Heaven, and therefore choſe them to Heaven, which the Papiſts ſtand much upon. I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fore-ſight of their Faith and good Works cannot be the cauſe of their Election, becauſe their Election is by God himſelf declared to be the cauſe of their Faith and good Works. If their Faith and Obedience be the effect of Election, they cannot be the cauſe of it; but ſo they are, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come to me,</hi> i. e. believe on me. Again, <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed,</hi> Act. 13.48. So for good Works, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30.</p>

But the word of God ſpeaks the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that God cannot be fruſtrated of his Choice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.10. <hi>The Counſel of the Lord ſtandeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all Generations.</hi> His Decrees are ſure, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. though his ſentence may be alter'd, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8, 9, 10.

Now if of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven, then they may be ſaved. But none are ſaved, ſave ſuch as are elected; therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fore-ſight of Faith or good Works, rational Creatures may be elected, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If fore-ſight of mens Works be the cauſe of their Election, then man hath whereof to glory. He is then the cauſe of his own Salvation. Election is the Original of all, a ſpring that runneth under ground for a time; firſt bubleth up and diſcovers it ſelf in effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſo glideth along in a life of Faith &amp; Holineſs, and at laſt emptieth it ſelf in the Ocean of Peace, and Joy, and Happineſs:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53132:58"/> So that if man be the Cauſe of his Election, then he may thank himſelf for his Salvation. <hi>John</hi> is no more beholden to God than <hi>Judas,</hi> for 'tis the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the freedom of his Will which brings him to Heaven. God did as much for <hi>Judas</hi> (ſay they) as for <hi>John.</hi> But how contrary is this to the word of Truth? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>But if</hi> Abraham <hi>were justified by Works, he had whereof to glory.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks in another Dialect, <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved, through Faith, not of Works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Eph. 2.4, 5. The Knife with which <hi>Adam</hi> cut his own Throat, and wherewith he murther'd his Poſterity, was Pride. He would hold of himſelf, and not of God. The wiſe and gracious God, in the way he hath taken for our Recovery, is pleaſed to lay this Knife as far as may be out of our way, leſt we be ruin'd by it a ſecond time: Though this Pride, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctrine of Merits, and fore-ſight of good Works maintains; but God tells us, Man is nothing, and God all in all; <hi>that no fleſh might glory in his preſence,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:53132:58"/>6. The Holy Ghoſt gives us the true ground or motive of Election, far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this of the Papiſts, and that is the Will and Pleaſure; <hi>Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated us according to the good Pleaſure of his Will,</hi> Epheſ. 1.5. <hi>Being predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated according to the purpoſe of him,</hi> verſ. 11.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Why Chriſt will try men at the Great Day by acts of Charity.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond queſtion to be diſcuſſed before I proceed to the Doctrine, is, why Chriſt tryeth men at that day by the neglect or performance of Charity, and not of ſome other Duty, as hearing, praying, watching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or by their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Humility, Temperance, or Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Theſe Works of Charity are by a Synechdoche put for new Obedience, and all the good works of a Chriſtians life. Though Chriſt mention thoſe as the teſt of men at that day, yet he doth not hereby exclude others. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abundantly proveth, that other Graces and Duties ſhall be rewarded at that day, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10, &amp;c. and that men ſhall be condemned for other ſins beſide the neglect of Charity. The want of the Wedding-Garment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12, 13. Unprofitableneſs in the improvement of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53132:60"/> Talents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30. We have a Bed-Roll of other ſins condemning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. Indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin, any ſin that men have lived in, and loved, who have died impenitent, will be found damnable at that day.</p>
               <p>It cannot rationally be ſuppoſed, that the performance or neglect of thoſe outward acts of Charity ſhould be the general teſt, (I mean of all) for how then ſhall thoſe that die in their Infancy and Childhood, or ſuch as are extreamly poor be tried, who are rendred wholly uncapable of feeding the Hungry, or cloathing the Naked. Neither do I judge it ſhall be the ſole teſt, for it's poſſible for a man in theſe outward acts to be bountiful to men, who hath no regard or fear of God in him. The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth a man <hi>may give all his Goods to the poor,</hi> and yet be void of true love to the poor, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. It's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, that the Worſhip of the bleſſed God is much more excellent than our kindneſs to the Children of men (as <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerveth on the Text) yet Chriſt who knoweth the hearts of all men, and from what principles they act,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53132:60"/> will mention the Saints acts of Charity at that day, and reward them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and will mention the Sinners omiſſion of Charity at that day, and condemn him for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe acts of Charity are more obvious and apparent to the World. Though the Chriſtian uſually is cloſe therein, and will not let his left hand know what his right hand doth; yet Charity, like Muſk, will diſcover it ſelf. The Objects thereof will publiſh their Benefactors; and he himſelf thinks it needful ſometimes to be open and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in his liberality (though not for ſelf-oſtentation, yet) for others imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Luther</hi> tells us, That Chriſt will try men this way, becauſe the World ſhall juſtifie his Sentence both of reward and puniſhment. If a man be charitable, all his Neighbours take notice of it; yea, commonly love him for it; the vileſt of them will commend him, though by his holy Converſation he condemns them. I ſuppoſe this is the good man of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, when he tells us, <hi>That for ſuch a one a man will even dare to die,</hi> Rom. 5. Therefore when Chriſt

Again, there is hardly a Muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, whoſe Motto is, To have, and to hold, to heap, and to hoard up, who will as ſoon part with his blood, as any thing conſiderable to the poor; but all his Neighbours, good and bad, obſerve him, ſpeak of him, and generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him for his earthly-mindedneſs. So that when Chriſt at the Great Day ſhall accuſe him, they will be forced to atteſt the truth of that Accuſation, and when Chriſt at that day ſhall condemn him, they cannot but agree to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.6, 7. <hi>The Righteous alſo ſhall ſee, and fear, and ſhall laugh at him.

Faith is a Grace ſeated in the heart, <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs;</hi> (where, by heart, I ſuppoſe is underſtood the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> for Faith, <hi>in habitu,</hi> is in each; and <hi>in exercitio,</hi> an act of both.) And the heart is called <hi>an hidden man,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. But it diſcovers it ſelf to the Believer by love. For when once the Soul applieth Chriſt for Pardon and Life, and begins to hope for thoſe great and good things which Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for him, and promiſed to him; this Faith kindleth an holy flame of Love in the affections to Chriſt, and hereby the Soul underſtands that he is a true Believer beloved of God; for our Love is but the reverberation of God's Love back again to himſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53132:62"/> And then Faith diſcovers it ſelf to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by theſe fruits and effects of love to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> feeding the Hungry, and cloathing the Naked. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That Faith works by love,</hi> as its Tool or Inſtrument, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. Love to God produceth love to his Saints, and love to the Saints will draw out the hand, and heart, and purſe to relieve them in their wants, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. Love is coſtly and expenſive, thinks nothing too much or too good for its Beloved. <hi>Mary's</hi> Box of Oyntment is very precious, but not too precious for her Lord. Life is worth all the World, yet laid down for a Chriſtian at the command of Love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe practical godlineſs, of which Charity is a part, will be that by which men ſhall be tried at the Great Day; our Lord Jeſus doth hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That it is not the Profeſſion, but the practice of Religion, that will be enquired into by the Judge of quick and dead. It is not ſaying, <hi>Be thou fed, and be thou cloathed;</hi> without giving where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be fed and cloathed: But it is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53132:62"/> feeding the Hungry, and cloathing the Naked, that ſhall be rewarded. Good words may pleaſe our ſelves, but good works only pleaſe God, and profit our own Souls. <hi>Not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> It's the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not the talking Chriſtian that hath the promiſe of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. It's the practical, not the verbal Chriſtian, that hath a right to Heaven through the precious blood of Chriſt, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe of God; <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the gates into the City.</hi> It is the real, not the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chriſtian, that is prepared for heaven. None are fit to do the will of God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but thoſe who have been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do the Will of God on Earth. There is a <hi>making meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. A young man by the School, is made meet for the Univerſity; and a Chriſtian by practical Holineſs, is fitted for eternal Happineſs.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:53132:63"/>
               <p>Our Redeemer would hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That all ſhews and ſhadows of Godlineſs, all gaudy Profeſſions, and curious flouriſhes of Religion, if void of good Works, though as Gloworms, they ſhine ſomewhat in the dark night of this World, yet in the long day of eternity they will all vaniſh and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. God will not then examine who hath been the greateſt Talker of his Will, but the greateſt Walker in his Way; nor who hath been the beſt Speaker, but who hath been the beſt Doer. <hi>For whoſo looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful Hearer, but a doer of the Work; this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed,</hi> Jam. 1.25. Hearing the Word, without doing the Work it commands, brings no bleſſing. The life and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Religion conſiſts in practiſing what is good, and not in praiſing what is good. It conſiſts in Scripture-Duties, not in Scripture Phraſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe Chriſt would hereby pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the World, the great reſpect he hath for Charity; therefore he tells us, He will take ſpecial notice of his Saints Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53132:63"/> at that day. Charity, whether in relieving the Oppreſſed, or comforting the Sorrowful, or counſelling the Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or ſupporting the Feeble, or feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hungry, or viſiting the Sick, or cloathing the Naked, is highly eſteemed of Chriſt. To what Duty hath he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed more or larger Promiſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.25. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.12. He ſpeaks of it, as if very much of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did conſiſt in it, and almoſt all of it. <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is to viſit the Fatherleſs and the Afflicted,</hi> James 1. ult. He ſlights our moſt ſevere Duties, (thoſe which are moſt irkſome to the fleſh) if this be wanting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.7, 8, 9, 10. He limits his own Mercy to the merciful, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.25. <hi>James</hi> 2.13. <hi>He is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a merciful High Priest,</hi> Heb. 5. <hi>He had compaſſion on the ignorant, and thoſe that were out of the way,</hi> Heb. 5.2. <hi>On thoſe that had nothing to eat,</hi> Matth. 15.32. <hi>On thoſe that were ſcattered as ſheep without a Shepheard,</hi> Matth. 9.36. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot but value exceedingly, and love tenderly thoſe that are like
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53132:64"/> him. That which lieth ſo near his heart, muſt needs be enquired after, as much, if not more than any thing elſe. And there is ſcarce any thing that ſpeaks our reſpect of perſons or things, more than our enquiry after them. <hi>Joſeph</hi> loved his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> dearly, I ſuppoſe far above all his Kindred, and therefore he firſt enquires after him. <hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the omiſſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Charity is included in this of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and will be as dangerous, if not more at the Great Day. The ſubject of it, the Soul is much more noble than the Body; therefore to ſuffer a Soul to periſh through our neglect of giving it ſpiritual Alms is a greater ſin, than to ſuffer the outward man to periſh for want of bodily Alms. Again, the end of ſpiritual Alms is higher, (than of bodily) the eternal Salvation of the Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Receiving the end of your Faith, the eternal ſalvation of your Souls.</hi> Both ſorts of Charity are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended into theſe two verſes.</p>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:53132:65"/>2. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That other Works, beſide Works of Charity, and other Omiſſions, beſide the Omiſſion of this Duty, will be mentioned at that Day, and men ſhall be judged according to them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all our Works will be then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. But you will ſay, What time will this take up. I anſwer, It ſeems probable, that the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may laſt longer than moſt imagine. The Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>That God will bring every Work into Judgment, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecret thing, whether it be good? or whether it be evil?</hi> Eccleſ. 12. ult. If every Work, then more than acts of Charity; and if every Work good or bad, open or ſecret, then the day of Judgment muſt be a long day. The Apoſtle ſpeaks the ſame as to the matter of Judgment, with the wiſe man, <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10.</p>
               <p>There are two of our eminent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines now with God, who have left their Judgment herein upon Record. One tells us, I humbly conceive, That the day of Judgment ſhall not be paſt over in an inſtant, but ſhall be of long

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Chriſt doth not ſay, Ye took my Meat from me, or wrong'd me of my Raiment, or perſecuted me, and caſt me into Priſon; <hi>But I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat; naked, and ye cloathed me not; in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi> He doth not ſay, I was hungry, and naked, and ſick, and inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ye derided me, and by your
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53132:66"/> taunts and jears, added Affliction to the afflicted, or ye deſpiſed and condemned me, as they, <hi>James</hi> 2.6. <hi>But I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ye gave me no meat,</hi> &amp;c. It was a bare omiſſion of a neceſſary Duty for which they are ſentenced to Hell.

               <p>Theſe words conſider'd thus relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the reaſon of Chriſts ſevere Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, will afford us this Doctrine which I chiefly intend.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> THat ſins of Omiſſion are dangerous and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Chriſt will ſentence men at the Great Day to eternal puniſhment of loſs and ſenſe, for not feeding the Hungry, and cloathing the Naked. Obſerve how naturally the Doctrine floweth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53132:66"/> from the Text, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels: For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat; thirſty, and ye gave me no drink,</hi> &amp;c. The ſin mentioned is a bare omiſſion, and the Sentence clearly ſpeaks the puniſhment: Hence I gather, <hi>That ſins of Omiſſion are damnable.</hi> Chriſt will ſentence men to Hell for them. <hi>Saul</hi>'s not ſlaying <hi>Agag,</hi> (an omiſſion) loſt him the Kingdom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.20, 26. The <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> were excluded the Sanctuary of God (an high and ſpecial Priviledge) to the tenth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, for an omiſſion, for not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iſrael</hi> with bread and water in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.4.</p>
               <p>But it's as clear, theſe ſins bring eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as well as temporal pains and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſlothful Servant is ſentenced, and ſent into utter darkneſs, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, for a bare omiſſion, for not improving his Talent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.24, <hi>to</hi> 31. The Servant did not waſte his Talent by Riotouſneſs, as the Prodigal did, (for he tells his Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Lo, here is thine,</hi>) only omit to improve it through idleneſs. But he who wanted
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53132:67"/> hands to work, had fetters provided for hands and feet. And he who would not work by the light, is rewarded with utter darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Again, we have a clear and full proof of the Doctrine, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And now alſo the Ax is laid to the root of the Trees: therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and caſt into the fire.</hi> In the verſe we have three parts conſiderable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. the <hi>Sin,</hi> and that is a bare omiſſion, the not bringing forth good fruit. Our Saviour ſpeaks the ſame in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.19. He doth not ſay, Every Tree that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth evil fruit is hewn down, that bringeth forth Drunkenneſs, or Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, or Uncleanneſs, or unſavory Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is caſt into the fire; <hi>But every Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit.</hi> The ſin is only a neglect of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſeverity of the puniſhment is, hewn down, and caſt into the fire. The hewing down, is the fitting and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sinner for the fire; as the Tree cut down, is prepared for burning. This is done by their provoking God to leave
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53132:67"/> them to impenitency, under the miniſtry of the Word. The Word is compared to a <hi>Sword,</hi> Epheſ. 6.17. <hi>A two-edged Sword,</hi> Rev. 1.16. And it will cut, and hack, and hew to purpoſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.5. <hi>God heweth them by his Prophets, and ſlays them by the word of his mouth. It cuts to the heart,</hi> Act. 4.54. Act. 5.33. And hath dreadful effects on them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>And he ſaid, go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but underſtand not; ſee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the hearts of this people fat, and make their Ears heavy, and ſhut their Eyes; leſt they ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and underſtand with their Hearts, and convert, and be healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this hewing them down is alſo by death. The Ax of death fells the Tree for the fire of Hell. The rotten Tree, or the barren Tree, is not good for fruit, therefore for the fire.</p>
               <p>He is hewn down, and caſt into the fire. Abſciſſion is the way to perdition, to eternal burning. This is the Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe of the barren Trees Tragedy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The certainty of it. Both Chriſt and the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſpeak of the puniſhment in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53132:68"/> the preſent Tenſe, not the Future, <hi>Is hewn down, and cast into the fire;</hi> not, ſhall be hewn down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The fruitleſs perſon ſhall as certainly be in Hell, as if he were there already; therefore promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and threatnings, though future, are delivered to us as preſent. As, <hi>to us a Son is born,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.9. <hi>Babylon is fallen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The univerſality of the Perſons, <hi>Every Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit.</hi> Every man, what ever his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion may be, or his Hopes are, or his Priviledges have been, <hi>if he bring not forth good fruit, he is hewn down, and caſt into the fire.</hi> The Doctrine being thus proved by Scripture, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Explication of it in ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſpeak to the nature of them, and ſhew what ſins of Omiſſion are.</p>

               <p>Firſt, COncerning the firſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the nature of them. I ſhall ſpeak to one more generally, and two more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the ſeveral diſtinctions of theſe Sins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By their agreement with, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from ſins of Omiſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. More generally, a ſin of Omiſſion is a neglect of ſome Duty commanded us in the Word of God.</p>
               <p>In every Command, there is a Precept and a Prohibition. A Precept en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, and a Prohibition forbidding. A Precept enjoyning ſome Duty, and a Prohibition forbidding the contrary. The neglect of doing what the Precept enjoyns, is a ſin of Omiſſion, and the doing what the Precept forbids is a ſin of commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The truth is, in every Commiſſion there is an Omiſſion; as in every deadly Diſeaſe ſomewhat of a Feavor. For in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53132:69"/> every Commiſſion, as in Drunkenneſs, or Oppreſſion, or Uncleanneſs, there is a neglect or omiſſion of the Duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as Temperance, Charity, and Chaſtity. But thoſe we moſt properly call ſins of Omiſſion, which are extrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from ſins of Commiſſion; as not praying, not reading the Word, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, not feeding the hungry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to ſpeak ſtrictly, there is no ſin but ſins of Omiſſion; for all ſin conſiſts in privation of due rectitude or deficiency, and coming ſhort of the rule. Though the Commands are generally deliver'd by way of negation, partly becauſe of the proneneſs of men to commit thoſe ſins that are forbidden, and God would by his Negative command, curb, and keep them in. Thou ſhalt not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou ſhalt not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> partly becauſe Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Commands bind more ſtrongly than the Affirmative. The Affirmative <hi>obligant ſemper,</hi> but not <hi>ad ſemper;</hi> but the Negative bind <hi>ſemper &amp; ad ſemper,</hi> as the School-men ſpeak. The Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive bind us always, (<hi>i. e.</hi> there is no time wherein it can be ſaid that they are of no force,) but not to all times. I
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53132:69"/> am always bound to pray, but I am not bound to pray at all times; I am bound always to ſpeak truth, but I am not bound to ſpeak all truth at all times. But Negative Commands bind always, and at all times; as, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> Theſe bind every moment of a mans life, I mean every moment of his life theſe ſins are to be forborn; they are at no time lawful: Though, I ſay, the Commands are deliver'd Negative for the moſt part, (<hi>viz.</hi> eight of them,) yet we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that all the Negative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God include their Affirmative; as, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods before me;</hi> this includes, thou ſhalt have me for thy God, thou ſhalt know me, love me, fear me, truſt me, and worſhip me as thy God. And when God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. this includes, thou ſhalt Worſhip me according to my Will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in my Word. When God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> this includes, thou ſhalt uſe reverently all my Names, Titles, Attributes, Ordinances, Word and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53132:70"/> Works. VVhen God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> this includes, thou ſhalt uſe all lawful means for the preſervation of thine own and thy Neighbours life. When God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi> this includes, thou ſhalt by all juſt ways maintain thine own and thy Neighbours Chaſtity, in thought, word, and deed. When God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal;</hi> this includes, thou ſhalt be true, faithful, and juſt in all thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Dealings with others, reſtore what is ill gotten, be diligent in thy Calling, and endeavour the furtherance of thy own and thy Neighbours eſtate by all juſt ways. When God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy Neighbour;</hi> this includes, thou ſhalt to thy power promote truth in thy ſelf and others, maintain thine own and thy Neighbours good Name. When God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> &amp;c. this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, thou ſhall be fully ſatisfied with thine own Condition, and deſire and delight in thy Neighbours proſperity. Thus the Negative Commands of God include their Affirmative, ſo that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the evil forbidden, is not to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53132:70"/> keep theſe Laws, unleſs alſo we practiſe the Duties commanded. The neglect of any of them is a ſin of Omiſſion.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Three diſtinctions about ſins of Omiſſion.</head>
               <p n="2">2. I Shall ſpeak more particularly, and explain theſe ſins:
<list>
                     <item>1. By theſe diſtinctions.</item>
                     <item>2. By their agreement with, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from ſins of Commiſſion.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe ſins of Omiſſion are to be diſtinguiſhed in regard of ſubſtance, manner or meaſure.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a duty is omitted in regard of the matter of it, as when men pray not, give not to the Poor, hear not the VVord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe omit the ſubſtance of the Duty. Of ſuch as thoſe God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>There is none that looketh after God,</hi> Rom. 3.11. And again, <hi>They will will not hear the Law of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 30.9. <hi>And he that turneth away his Ears from the cry of the poor, he alſo ſhall cry himſelf, but ſhall not be heard,</hi> Prov.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53132:71"/> 21.13. Theſe are moſt deeply guilty before God. They ſhew their utter contempt of him, and openly manifeſt it to others; when they omit to relieve the Poor, to pray in their Families, or to attend publick praying and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; hereby they are ſcandalous and offenſive. They grieve the godly, <hi>Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wicked forſake thy Laws,</hi> Pſal. 119. and they harden the wicked. VVhen ungodly men ſee others neglect all Religion, they are encouraged in their Atheiſm and Irreligion; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming others are wiſe, and that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall fare as well as others. As it was ſaid of thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.21. ſo it may be ſaid of theſe; <hi>They ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked.</hi> Again, theſe are guilty in all reſpects; they who offend in the matter of a Command, by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Duty it ſelf in the ſubſtance thereof, offend in the manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure alſo; but they who offend in the manner and meaſure, may not offend in the matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. VVhen the omiſſion is in regard of the manner of the duties perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53132:71"/> As when men do pray, but they pray not <hi>uprightly,</hi> with the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Thou art nigh their mouths, but far from their reins.</hi> Nor <hi>earneſtly,</hi> with their whole heart, and with all their heart, and all the powers of their Souls, as the Precept is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.13. and that Prayer to which the Promiſe is annexed, <hi>James</hi> 5.16. But pray (as if they pray'd not) formally, and cuſtomarily, and careleſly; ſcarce hearing themſelves, and no wonder then if God hear them not; they pray not <hi>reverently,</hi> with the aw of God upon their Spirits, but are raſh in their words, and irreverent in their hearts, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1, 2. So when men give Alms, but do not give chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with a free, willing, ready heart; <hi>For God loves a chearful giver,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.17. Nor ſeaſonably, when it may do moſt good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Say not to thy Neighbour, Go and come again to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when thou haſt it by thee.</hi> So when men hear the Word, but hear not <hi>awfully,</hi> in the fear of God, as in the preſence of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. <hi>We are all here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before God, to hear all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee of God:</hi> Neither hear
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53132:72"/> believingly, giving their aſſent to what they hear, and applying it to their own Souls. <hi>The Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,</hi> Heb. 4.2. Theſe, and ſuch like, though they are not guilty of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in regard of the matter of a Duty; yet they are guilty of omiſſion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner of it; though they do the thing commanded, yet they do it not as it is commanded, and ſo are guilty of the breach of a poſitive Law and Command.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the omiſſion is in regard of the meaſure of the Duty; As when a man gives Alms, but not anſwerable to his Eſtate; though God hath filled his Belly with hidden treaſures, and waters of a full Cup are wrung out to him, and he is able to give pounds to poor indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Families, he puts them off with a few pence, or at moſt ſhillings, this is an omiſſion in regard of the meaſure. God expects charitable Contributions from men anſwerable to his Bounty to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt day of the week let every one of you lay by him in ſtore, as God hath proſpered him, that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53132:72"/> there be no gatherings when I come.</hi> According to the meaſure of the Divine Mercy to us, ſuch ſhould be the meaſure of our Charity to others. According to the ſeed thrown into the Earth, is the Crop return'd by the good ground. Therefore to make ſcanty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, when we have large Receipts, is a ſin of omiſſion: So when men pray, but not with that frequency which they might and ought. The Command is, <hi>To pray contiuually, to pray without ceaſing, to pray evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which muſt include at leſt frequent, <hi>i. e.</hi> daily prayer, each Morning and Evening; but ſome men pray, but it's only at certain ſeaſons, now and then, by fits and ſtarts: Some pray only upon the Lords-Days, as if they had liberty all the working-days to be Atheiſts, and neglect the owning of the great God. Others pray only under ſome Affliction; and as Patients to their Phyſitian, never go to God, but when they cannot tell what to do without him. So the <hi>Jews, In their Affliction, they will ſeek me early,</hi> Hoſ. 5.15. <hi>When he ſmote them, then they ſought him, but their heart was not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53132:73"/> right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78.34, 37. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs of Pulſe argues a diſtemper'd Body, ſo doth unevenneſs in Duties a diſtemper'd Soul. <hi>In their trouble they will pour out a prayer.</hi> When troubles are on them, they will make bold to trouble God, and call him up for their help. God expects frequency of Application to him every day, and greater frequency of thoſe that have more time, and fewer Obſtacles and Impediments than others. Now the putting God off with Applications to him, and Acknowledgments of him once a week, inſtead of every day, and much under Affliction, inſtead of doing it in all conditions, and at all ſeaſons; or putting him off with Morning-Prayer only, inſtead of Morning and Evening-Prayer, or with Family-Prayer only, when we ſhould alſo pray in our Cloſets daily; theſe are ſins of Omiſſion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the meaſure of the Duty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe ſins of omiſſion are either partial or total.</p>
               <p>Total omiſſions are, when men wholly neglect the Duties commanded, as when
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53132:73"/> they altogether caſt off Praying, and Hearing, and giving Alms, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their own hearts; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3, 4. <hi>They are all gone aſide, there is none that doth good: They call not upon God.</hi> A man may read the Word <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in the fore-heads of theſe men. They carry about them where-ever they go the ſign and mark of Condemnation. They pleaſe themſelves poſſibly that they do not abound in ſcandalous ſins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not conſidering that they may be guilty of ſelf-murther, as well by ſtarving or not feeding their Souls, as by ſtabbing or poiſoning their Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Partial Omiſſions are, when men do ſometimes perform the Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but not with that conſtancy which they ought, <hi>Job</hi> 15.4. <hi>Thou caſteſt off fear, and restraineſt prayer before God;</hi> i. e. Thou impriſoneſt Prayer, and doſt not afford it the liberty it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had: It was wont to appear every day openly, but now it is kept in, and ſhews it ſelf but ſeldom.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sins of omiſſion are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into external or internal omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:53132:74"/>1. External Omiſſions are a neglect of the outſide (as I may call it) of the Command.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Internal Omiſſions are the neglect of the inſide of the Command: We muſt know, that in every Command there is an <hi>Extra</hi> and an <hi>Intra,</hi> an Out-ſide and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſomewhat that concerns the Hands &amp; Converſation, ſomewhat that concerns the Heart and Affections. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, In the Fourth Command of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Sabbath, there God commands us to ſpend the whole time of his day (except ſo much as the works of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Mercy call for) in religious Exerciſes, and the Duties of his own worſhip, as Praying, Reading, Hearing, Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the bare performance of theſe Duties is the out-ſide of the Command, and he who doth them (though cuſtomarily) obeys the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand literally,; but the ſanctifying the Name of God in theſe Duties, and the performance of them with Reverence, Humility, Faith, Love, Joy, according to the ſeveral duties, and ſeveral parts of them, is the inſide of the Command; and he alone that performeth theſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53132:74"/> Duties in ſuch a manner, obeyeth the Law ſpiritually. The neglect of the former is an external Omiſſion, for which God threatens Families and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>Pour out thy wrath upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not upon thy Name,</hi> Jer. 10.25. They who will not deprecate the wrath of God, muſt feel it; and they who will not intreat his Favour, muſt go without it. So the not caſting the inceſtuous Perſon out of the Church, was an external omiſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. The neglect of the latter, <hi>i. e.</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Sabbath-Duties in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned manner, is an internal omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus God complains of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that though they pray'd, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly made long Prayers, yet God counts their prayers as no prayers, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Omiſſions: <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> They put up (it may be) ſome lazy Petitions, but they pour out no hearty Deſires: Nay, God curſeth men for doing his work neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10. <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> The agreement and difference between ſins of Omiſſion and ſins of Commiſsion.</head>
               <p n="2">2. IT will further explain theſe ſins of Omiſſion, to conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Omiſſions and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as alſo their agreement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They agree in the Authority for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them. The ſame God forbids each ſin; He that ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> The ſame ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerve me diligently,</hi> Exod. 20. Jer. 48.10. Matth. 22.37. <hi>With all thy heart,</hi> Matth. 7.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are both againſt the ſame particular Command. In the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand wherein he forbids <hi>theft,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>diligence</hi> in our Callings, and the uſe of all lawful means for the increaſe of our own Eſtates. In the ſame Law wherein he forbids <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Care and endeavour to preſerve our own and our Neighbours Chaſtity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They are both a privation of that Rectitude which is required by the Law to the goodneſs of every action. For if
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53132:75"/> 
                  <hi>malitia moralis, non eſt quid poſitivum,</hi> If there be nothing poſitive in the formal nature of ſin, according to the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (as there can be nothing poſitive in it, unleſs we will make God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it,) but a want of a conformity to the Law; then every Commiſſion is an Omiſſion in this reſpect, and ſo they agree in their formal nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They agree in their fruit and effect; ſins of Commiſſion exclude Heaven, and condem to Hell. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven? Be not deceived, neither For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, nor Adulterers, nor Drunkards, nor Covetous, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. Epheſ. 5.9. and ſo do ſins of Omiſſion, as the Text doth abundantly prove.</p>
               <p>The difference between ſins of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſins of Commiſſion conſiſteth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that ſins of Commiſſion are againſt a Negative Law, and ſins of Omiſſion are againſt an Affirmative Law, Oppreſſion is againſt a Negative Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs thy Neighbour, Thou ſhalt not oppreſs a Stranger.</hi> Neglect of Charity is againſt an Affirmative Law;

                  <hi>Give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow, turn not thou away,</hi> Matth. 5.42.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in this; Every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion proceeds originally from a ſin of Omiſſion, but ſins of Omiſsion do not proceed originally from ſins of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. All ſin ſpringeth from this, The departure of the heart from God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. and the want of true love to, and fear of his Majeſty, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. which are ſins of Omiſsion. Where there is no love to God, there is no care to forbear what he forbids, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.24. <hi>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my ſayings.</hi> And where there is no fear of God, all manner of wickedneſs will abound, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1.2. <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a wicked mans Omiſsion from his ſins of Commiſsion. The tranſgreſsion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, <hi>That there is no fear of God before his eyes;</hi> i. e. His ſcandalous Practices, and ſins of Commiſsion, tell me, That he is guilty of inward Omiſsions, <hi>That there is no fear of God before his eyes.</hi> He who caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off fear, will ſoon let the Reins looſe to all Licentiouſneſs. <hi>They who
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53132:79"/> called not on God will devour</hi> Jacob, <hi>and make waste his dwelling-place,</hi> Jer. 10. ult. No ſin comes amiſs to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9, <hi>to</hi> 14. The monſtrous, horrid, unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſins of the Heathen had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſins of Omiſsion. <hi>When they knew God,</hi> (i. e. by the light of nature, which plainly ſpeaks a Deity) <hi>they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him not as God; (e. i.</hi> did not love him, fear him, truſt in him, honour him as God,) <hi>neither were thankful,</hi> (did not acknowledge their Ingagements to him, for their noble Beings, and manifold Mercies): Theſe were ſins of Omiſsion; but what followeth upon them? Truly unnatural beſtiality, unrighteouſneſs, fornication, wickedneſs, covetouſneſs, maliciouſneſs, envy, murther, pride, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 21.21, <hi>to the end.</hi> Men leave the fountain of living Waters, and then hew themſelves broken Ciſterns which will hold no water, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p>The firſt and great ſin of Mankind proceeded from an omiſsion. <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart was turned from God by Unbelief, (I humbly conceive) before ever his Hand touched, or Tongue taſted the forbidden fruit. But now ſins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53132:80"/> do not proceed originally from ſins of Commiſsion; <hi>James</hi> 1.14, 15. <hi>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed. Then when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin: and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi>

               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">Barlow exercit.</note>3. They differ in this, that ſins of Commiſsion are founded in ſome act or habit: Sins of Omiſsion only in the Soul, without acts or habits. 1. There is ſomewhat poſitive about ſins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, but nothing about ſins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that is the reaſon. 2. As Drunkenneſs is an immoderate uſe of Beer or Wine: Here is an act of the Creature, and much poſitive about this ſin, though nothing poſitive in the ſin it ſelf. So in theft another ſin of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, there is ſomewhat poſitive about the taking away our Neighbours goods, and keeping them as our own; but in ſins of Omiſsion there is nothing poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; as in not praying, not hearing, not believing, not giving to the Poor; there is nothing poſitive, no acts, but a neglect of acts required. Sins of Omiſsion are wholly privative, and have nothing of poſitivity in them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:53132:80"/>4. They differ in this, that ſins of Commiſsion are more ſcandalous in the eyes of men than ſins of Omiſsion. I do not ſay ſins of Omiſsion are always leſs hainous than ſins of Commiſsion, (I ſhall prove by and by they may be more hainous) but that they are leſs ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Sins of Commiſsion, as Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Uncleanneſs, Theft, Swearing, Murther; theſe make a great noiſe in the World, are taken notice of by all, and with the Snail, leave a ſlime and filth behind them whereſoever they are; But ſins of Omiſsion, as not praying in our Cloſets, not examining our own Hearts, not relieving the Poor and Needy, not bringing up our Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are more ſtill and quiet, obſerved by few or none.</p>

They differ in this, that ſins of Omiſsion are the averſion of the heart from God, and ſins of Commiſsion are the converſion of the heart to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſomewhat below God. Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion turns the heart from God: Hence we read of mans going far from God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. and of their departing away
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53132:81"/> from the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. Which is not meant in regard of local motion, (for ſo none can depart from God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2, 3, 4, 5.) but in regard of their inward carnal Affections, and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Converſations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are a turning to the Creature, <hi>Whoſe heart is after covetouſneſs. They imagine miſchief in their hearts,</hi> Pſal. 140.2. Eccleſ. 9.3. <hi>The heart of the Sons of men is full of evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſpoken to the nature of ſins of Omiſsion in general, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by their ſeveral diſtinctions, and their agreement with, and difference from ſins of Commiſsion; I come to the ſecond thing promiſed in the explication of the Doctrine, and that is the danger of them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> The danger of ſins of Omiſsion, in the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nature of them, and their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs to God.</head>
               <p>Secondly, THe danger of ſins of Omiſſion; though men are ready to conceive that ſins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe they make no great cry in the World, are but infirmities, are venial ſins, and are not much to be regarded, as having little of danger to the Soul in them; yet the contrary will appear plainly, if we conſider theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The malignity and ſinfulneſs of them ſpeaks their danger. The more venome and poyſon there is in any Cup or Diſh, the more dangerous it muſt needs be; the more ſinfulneſs there is in any ſin, the more hazardous it is to the Soul. Now I ſhall ſhew the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of omiſſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are moſt againſt the mind and will of God. Thoſe ſins are the greateſt, which moſt croſs the Will of the Law-giver;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53132:82"/> 
                  <hi>For ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> or Mind, <hi>of God.</hi> And every one knoweth that the Mind of God is more in the Precept, or Affirmative part of the Law, than in the Prohibition, or Negative part of it. The Precept or performance of the Duty commanded is the main thing, the Prohibition is, as it were, accidental, in order to our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Precept;<note place="margin">Mens legis eſt lex.</note> therefore ſins of Omiſsion being againſt the ſubſtance and principal part of the Command, and ſo moſt directly againſt that which is the ſpecial Mind of the Law-giver, muſt needs be the greateſt Sins. It is more good to do good, than not to do evil. Omiſsions are not to be eſteemed bare Negations or Privations, but as breaches of a poſitive Law, wherein the mind of God is moſt diſcover'd. Now how great a Sin, and how dangerous is it to croſs the Mind of God? ſurely it's bad thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that can caſt Body and Soul into Hell;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide ante,</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion &amp; commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>fear him,</hi> Matth. 10.28.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sins of Omiſsion are the ground of, and make way for Sins of Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The want of love to God and our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53132:82"/> not believing his Word, which are Sins of Omiſsion, are the ground of all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. When a man once caſteth off daily reading the Word, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God by Prayer, or performs thoſe Duties coldly and careleſly; he throws himſelf out of God's Protection, and ſo becomes a Lacquey to the Devil, and a tame Slave to every Luſt to trample on, and tyranize over at pleaſure; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3, 4. <hi>They are all gone aſide, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together filthy: there is none that doth good, no not one. Negligentiam in orando ſemper aliqua notabilis tranſgreſsio ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> ſaith One; always ſome notable Sin followeth upon ſlothfulneſs in prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi>'s not watching his Eyes and Heart, and his not imploying his time better at that hour of the day, brought forth Drunkenneſs, Murder, Adultery, Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some Sins of Omiſsion are like great men, that never go without many Followers; admit their Perſons, you muſt admit their long train which they bring with them. So a <hi>Gad,</hi> a whole troop of ugly luſts will throng in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our neglect of one Duty.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:53132:83"/>
               <p>Not doing good, fits the heart for doing evil: The ground not ſown with good Corn, doth naturally of its own accord bring forth evil weeds. Indeed, it's impoſsible for him that doth no good, not to do evil. He that doth not gather with Chriſt, ſcattereth; and <hi>he that is not with me is againſt me,</hi> Matth. 12.30. He that fights not for his Prince in a day of Battel, is his Enemy; and that Servant who helps not his Maſter in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, hinders him. Not to ſave a life when we may, is to deſtroy and murther it. The Negative Chriſtian will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall to be a poſitive Atheiſt and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. If the Heart be empty of good, and ſwept clean of Grace, the unclean Spirit will quickly take up his logding in it. Beſides, God doth often judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally give up them to commit Evil, who refuſe to do good. <hi>Becauſe they received not the truth in the love of it,</hi> (here is a Sin of Omiſsion) <hi>God gave them up to ſtrong deluſions, that they might believe a lye,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. Now how great and dangerous is this Sin, that uſhers in ſo many Sins? Alas, one Sin is too weighty for thy Soul to bear; how
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53132:83"/> heavy then will that whole rabble and regiment of ſins be, that one ſin of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may bring along with it? If I live in Sins of Omiſsion, Sins of Commiſsion will follow both naturally and judicially.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sins of Commiſsion do exceedingly grieve the Spirit of God: Indeed every Sin is offenſive to the Holy Ghoſt, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Holineſs, as directly contrary to its nature; but the Spirit of God ſets a particular, ſpecial brand and mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Sins, as grievous to him; <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which is good, rejoyce evermore, pray without ceaſing. In every thing give thanks, quench not the Spirit, deſpiſe not Propheſying,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Obſerve, the Duties are all poſitive, (the neglect whereof is a Sin of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to which he exhorts them, if they would not quench the Spirit. The Spirit is not only grieved, but alſo quenched by Sins of Omiſsion. Fire may be quenched by with-drawing fewel from it, as well as by throwing water on it. By ſcandalous Sins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, we throw water on this heavenly Flame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> quench it; but by neglecting to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4+ letters">
                     <desc>••••…</desc>
                  </gap>d to attend on Propheſying,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53132:84"/> and ſuch Sins of Omiſsion, we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw fewel from it, and thereby put it out. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would not hear the Voice of God, they are ſaid <hi>to grieve his holy Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 95. And when they believed not his Word, the Wonders that he wrought, they are ſaid <hi>to vex his holy Spirit,</hi> Iſa. 63.10. with <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Then they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit.</hi> Not to obey God, is to diſobey him. Not to be loyal to him, is to be rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; now hereby they vexed his holy Spirit. Now how great a Sin, and how dangerous is it to grieve the Spirit of God; the ſize or meaſure of Sin, is to be taken from the Majeſty ſlighted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed, and offended by it. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is God, an infinite boundleſs Being, whom theſe Sins of Omiſsion grieve and vex. Again, how dangerous is it to grieve and drive the Spirit from us: It's the Spirit that muſt enable us to our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. Direct us in our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. Comfort us in our Sorrows, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1, 2, 3. It is the Spirit, that is, the Spirit of Grace and Holineſs, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1.4.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53132:84"/> and muſt work them in our hearts, if ever we be gracious and holy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. It is the Spirit muſt ſtrengthen us with might in our inward man, to keep the Commandments of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Ezez.</hi> 36.27. It is the Spirit that is the earneſt of our Inheritance, the Firſt-fruits of our eternal bleſſed Harveſt, and that muſt ſeal us up unto the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. How great a Sin, and how dangerous therefore is it to grieve this Spirit, and by Sins of Omiſsion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe him to with-draw from us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom we are unable unto any good, and indeed expoſed to all evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The danger of theſe Sins will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by their offenſiveneſs to God. Since our Felicity depends on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and our Miſery on his Anger, (Hell it ſelf being but his wrath ever to come, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi>) thoſe Sins which are highly provoking to God, muſt be very dangerous. If in his Favour be Life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. and his Wrath be worſe than Death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. I had need to beware how I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to jealouſie. Now the not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53132:85"/> believing God, which is a ſin of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is called <hi>the Provocation,</hi> Pſal. 95.8, 9. <hi>Harden not your hearts, as in the Provocation, as in the day of temptation in the Wilderneſs: When your Fathers tempted me, proved me, and ſaw my Works.</hi> This Provocation was their not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Word, for all the Wonders he had wrought for them. They ſaid, <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs? Behold he ſmote the Rock, that waters guſhed out: Can he give Bread alſo? Can he provide Fleſh for his people? Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: So a fire was kindled againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>and anger alſo came up againſt</hi> Iſrael: <hi>becauſe they believed not in God, and truſted not in his Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 78.19. <hi>to</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>It will appear how provoking ſins of Omiſſion are to God by theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his frequent Reprehenſions, and complaints of men for them. He blames men for not ſacrificing, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.18. for not mourning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And ſharply reproves for not receiving Correction, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.30. <hi>In vain have I ſmitten your Children, they received no Correction;</hi> For
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53132:85"/> not grieving when ſmitten, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. For not ſeeking God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.13. Nay, obſerve what ſpecial notice he takes of, and how ſadly he aggravates their Omiſſions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I ſaid after ſhe had done all theſe things,</hi> (i. e. gone up upon every high Mountain, and upon every green Tree,) <hi>Turn thou unto me, but ſhe turned not.</hi> Here he complains of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Omiſſion, in not turning to him; but mark how he accents <hi>Judahs</hi> Omiſſion, who knew what <hi>Iſrael</hi> had done, and how God had put her away, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Yet her treacherous Siſter</hi> Judah <hi>feared not,</hi> (the dreadful doom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtruck no aw into the heart of <hi>Judah.</hi>) And <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>And yet for all this</hi> (that <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and been ſeverely puniſhed for,) <hi>her treacherous Siſter</hi> Judah <hi>hath not turned unto me with the whole heart, but feignedly, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Here was an Omiſſion internal, or in the manner of her Converſation; it was not ſincere, but with diſſimulation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By his ſevere Comminations and Threatnings denounced againſt thoſe that are guilty of Omiſſions. He curſeth thoſe that deny him their help in a day
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53132:86"/> of Battel, and that come not forth to help the Lord againſt the mighty, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.23. He curſeth thoſe that are not diligent about his Work, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10. And believe it, his Curſe is effectual, not like the diſcharge of a piece with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only, which doth no execution. Thoſe whom he curſeth, are curſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: His curſe, like Lightning, blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and withereth where-ever it cometh. <hi>I curſed his habitation,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> not as a private Malediction of his own Spirit, but as a pious Praediction of Gods Spirit.) Now mark what followeth upon God's curſing the wicked mans Habitation, <hi>Job</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. His houſe is by this breath of God tumbling to the ground preſently. <hi>His Children</hi> (that ſhould be the honour and ſupport of it) <hi>are far from ſafety,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>they are cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gate, and there is none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them,</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>Whoſe harvest the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry eateth up, and taketh out of the thorns, and the Robber ſwalloweth up his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> His Eſtate, which is a ſecond thing requiſite to the outward glory of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that is ſeiſed on, and ſnatched from him. So God threatneth multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53132:86"/> with his wrath (which is ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo intollerable, that none can ſtand before it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.8. that Mountains are moved, Rocks are rent in pieces, the Foundations of the Earth tremble at it; yea, that God's own people are ready to be diſtracted at it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.3, 4, 5.) for a Sin of Omiſsion, <hi>For not calling on his Name,</hi> Jer. 10. ult.</p>
               <p>God threatneth to cut a man off from his people (which includes either a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off from the ſociety of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here and hereafter, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. or of being cut off out of the Land of the living by the Sword of the Magiſtrate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.33. or both, as ſome think,) for a meer omiſſion. <hi>But a man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth to keep the Paſsover; even the ſame Soul ſhall be cut off from his people,</hi> Numb. 9.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It appears, that Sins of Omiſsion are highly provoking to God, by the execution of his Judgments on them that are guilty of them. His Works as well as his Word ſpeak his great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt theſe ſins. <hi>Saul</hi> loſt his Kindgom, for not killing <hi>Agag</hi> and the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53132:87"/> beſt of the Flock, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Word of the Lord, the Lord hath alſo rejected thee from being King,</hi> ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi> to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23, 26, 28. <hi>Ahab</hi> omitted to kill <hi>Benhadad,</hi> and loſt his life for it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.42. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt let go a man out of thy hand, whom I appointed to utter destruction, thy life ſhall go for his life. Eli</hi> was a good man, and as much in Gods Favour, but by not reproving his Sons, he ſo far incurred Gods anger, that he loſt his two wicked Fondlings in a day, and the Prieſt-hood for ever, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.12, 13, <hi>&amp;c. Moſes</hi> was God's ſpecial Friend and Favorite: <hi>And the Lord ſpake to</hi> Moſes <hi>face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to his Friend,</hi> Exod. 33.11. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>thou haſt found grace in my ſight, and I know thee by Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet when this <hi>Moſes</hi> is guilty of an Omiſsion, that he doth not believe God, nor ſanctifie his Name in the eyes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he is excluded the temporal <hi>Canaan, Numb.</hi> 20.12. Though <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken up to the Mount, to converſe with God forty days together, when <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the people muſt ſtay
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53132:87"/> below; though <hi>Moſes</hi> was honour'd to ſee the Commands written with God's own Hand; though <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken into a Rock, while God paſſed before him, that he might hear his Name, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God gracious,</hi> &amp;c. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and ſee his back parts; though God was pleaſed to confer with <hi>Moſes,</hi> as one Friend with another; yet when this <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to be guilty of ſuch an Omiſsion, he is denied liberty to enter into the Land flowing with Milk and Honey. Nay, though this <hi>Moſes</hi> begs ſo hard, <hi>I pray thee let me go over, and ſee the good Land beyond</hi> Jordan, <hi>that goodly Mountain and</hi> Lebanon; Yet God was ſo provoked by his Omiſsion, that though he had heard him once and again for greater things on the behalf of others, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11. <hi>to</hi> 15. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.10. He would not hear him in this ſmall Requeſt for himſelf; <hi>But his wrath was kindled, and he would not hear me, and ſaid, let it ſuffice thee, ſpeak no more unto me of this matter,</hi> Deut. 3.25, 26.</p>
               <p>Nay, how angry was Chriſt with the man who had not a Wedding-Garment
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53132:88"/> at his Supper; how ſevere is his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? how dreadful his Doom? <hi>And when the King came in to ſee the Gueſts, he ſaw there a man which had not a Wedding-Garment.</hi> Though but one in a Crowd, Chriſt ſpied him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is his Tranſgreſſion: We do not read, that the man ſlighted the Invitation, and denied to come, as they in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. nor that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Servants ſpitefully, and ſlew them, as thoſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. We do not read, that the man came to the Feaſt in a drunken-fit, or reproached and abuſed either the Maſter or Gueſts, but only omitted to bring with him a Wedding-Garment, which ſome ſay is Charity; others Obedience; he was a Profeſſor, but without godly practices; but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is meant Chriſt, and the Graces of the Spirit, which are compared to a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>And that ye be renewed in the Spirit of your Minds. And that ye put on the new man.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="3">3. THe danger of Sins of Omiſſion will appear by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructiveneſs to men. The more wrong and injury any Sin doth us, the more danger is in it. Now what hath been already ſpoken, doth abundantly evince this. If Omiſſions are ſo great ſins, that they moſt directly croſs the mind of the Law, and make way for all Sins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and exceedingly grieve the Spirit of God, they muſt needs be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſtructive to men. If God himſelf blame them ſo ſharply, threaten
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53132:89"/> them ſo ſeverely, and puniſh them ſo grievouſly, who are guilty of ſuch ſins; then theſe Sins muſt be very injurious to us. But it will further appear, if you conſider that they cauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Judgments of God on men, in regard of their Bodies, or external Comforts. He puniſheth many with extream penury, for not being diligent in their particular Callings. <hi>Their idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (which is a ſin of Omiſsion) <hi>cloaths them with rags,</hi> Prov. 23.21. Again, <hi>The idle Soul ſhall ſuffer hunger,</hi> Prov. 19.15. How doth experience prove the truth of this. Many begin the World (as we ſay) with conſiderable Eſtates, who, in a few years, for lack of care and induſtry in their Imploys, have waſted all. The idle man may call the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Brother. Beſides, theſe Sins of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion are puniſhed with a temporal deſtruction. The Lord having ſaved the people out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards deſtroyed them that believed not, <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was God's own people, his peculiar treaſure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. a people nigh unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. <hi>ult.</hi> incomparable for this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53132:90"/> and other Priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. Yet when guitly of this Omiſsion, God would not ſpare them, but deſtroy'd them. No Priviledges can exempt from puniſhment. God may forſake his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle at <hi>Shiloth;</hi> deliver his ſtrength into captivity, and his glory into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hand, if they will not believe him, if they will not obey him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.60, 61.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A judicial tradition to ſpiritual Judgments. Of all Judgments, none in this World are ſo dreadful as thoſe that are ſpiritual; bodily Judgments touch the Fleſh, but theſe the Spirit. When God would ſpeak and wreak his anger againſt a perſon or people to the utmoſt; he doth it this way, by giving them up to their own wickedneſs. When he would ſtrike <hi>Ephraim</hi> under the fifth Rib, and kill him at a blow, it is by this Judgment. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone,</hi> Hoſ. 4.17. He is given to Idolatry, let him take his fill of it, and ſee what the end will be. He is fond of lyes and vanities, and delights in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting himſelf to their embraces; <hi>Let him alone.</hi> Let none diſturb him, or recall him; let no Mercy, no Miſery, no
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53132:90"/> Means, no Miniſtry ever hinder him in the proſecution of his Luſts, or ſtop him in his courſe, much leſs be effectual for his Repentance and Amendment. In temporal Judgments, God acts the part of a Father, to whip his Child, that he may reclaim him for his Errors, and be fit to inherit his Eſtate. But in ſpiritual, God acts the part of a Judge, to deliver the Malefactor over to Execution. In the former, he prunes the Tree, that it may bring forth fruit, and ſo continue in his Garden to his joy and delight; but in the latter, he leaves the Tree as unſound and barren, to be cut down for the fire. Now ſins of Omiſſion cauſe God to deliver men up to theſe Judgments. God calls upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> to hear and obey him, they will not. <hi>But my People would not hearken to my Voice,</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me.</hi> What was the reſult of their refuſal? <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels,</hi> Pſal. 81.11, 12. God doth not teſtifie his anger for their contempt of him, by ſending Plague, or Flames, or wild Beaſts among them. He doth not ſay, Well, ſince they thus
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53132:91"/> ſlight my Authority, I will be avenged on them to purpoſe, I will give them up to the Sword, or Famine, or racking Diſeaſes, or greedy devouring Lions, which would have been ſad and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; but he executes on them a far more ſad and grievous Judgment, when he ſaith, <hi>So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi> God's leaving one Soul to one luſt, is far worſe than leaving him to all the Lions in the World. Alas, it will tear the Soul worſe than a Lion can do the Body, and rent it in pieces, when there is none to deliver it. God's gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them up to their own wills, that they walked in their own counſels, is in effect a giving them up to eternal wrath and woe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The deſtructiveneſs of Sins of Omiſſion to the Souls of men appears, in that they render the Condition of men deſperate, and without remedy. Sins of Commiſſion wound the Soul dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly, but ſins of Omiſſion make the ſtate of the Patient hopeleſs and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Sins of Commiſſion are directly againſt the Law, and ſo bind the Sinner
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53132:91"/> over to its Curſe; but Sins of Omiſſion are directly againſt the Goſpel, and thereby hinder the Patients Cure, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> He that hath broken the Precepts of the Law, is liable to its puniſhment; but yet this Sinner may flie to the Goſpel, as his City of Refuge, and lay hold on Chriſt there tendered for Pardon and Life. But by ſome ſins of Omiſſion, he rendereth the Goſpel inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for his good, and himſelf unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the good things promiſed in it. Faith and Repentance are the two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon which all the exceeding rich and precious Promiſes depend; ſo that by not believing, and not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are Sins of Omiſſion, men deny themſelves all the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Goſpel. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>He upbraided the Cities wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, becauſe they repented not. Woe to thee</hi> Corazin, <hi>woe to thee</hi> Bethſaida, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Matth. 11.21, 22, 23. Sins of Commiſſion make the wound, and Sins of Omiſſion keep off that Plaiſter, which alone can heal it. Sins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53132:92"/> plunge us into a bottomleſs gulph of Miſery, and Sins of Omiſſion ſtop the current of that Mercy that alone can relieve and ſuccour us. Theſe Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are like men in ſwoons, gaſping for breath, and ready to expire; yet ſhut their mouths, and faſten their teeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to keep out thoſe Cordials that alone can recall them to life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The danger of Sins of Omiſſion will appear, by our proneneſs to ſlight and neglect them. If Sins of Omiſſion are of ſo deadly a nature, as moſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Will of God, and ſo highly provoking to him, and ſo mortally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to us; then the more we ſlight this great Enemy, the more dangerous it is to us: A weak enemy, and an enemy that can do us little harm, may be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without great danger. But when an enemy is ſo powerful, ſo deadly, ſo damnable, our contempt of him is a great advantage to him, and a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to us; for by this means he falls upon us diſarmed and unprepared for him. <hi>Pompey</hi> ſlighted <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when News firſt came to <hi>Rome</hi> of his march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Italy</hi> with his Army, and ſaid,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53132:92"/> 
                  <hi>That if did but ſtamp with his foot, he ſhould therewith fetch Souldiers enough out of all parts to ſubdue</hi> Caeſar. And ſo made ſmall preparation to reſiſt him, which was his own and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths deſtruction. Truly, thus men are apt to ſlight ſins of Omiſſion, and thereby to undo themſelves. As it's ſaid of <hi>Joab,</hi> He ſpake kindly to <hi>Amaſa,</hi> and made as if he would kiſs him: <hi>But</hi> Amaſa <hi>took no heed to the Sword that was in</hi> Joabs <hi>hand: ſo he ſmote him therewith in the fifth rib, and ſhed out his bowels to the ground, that he died,</hi> 2 Sam. 20.9, 10. Thus ſin of Omiſsion is familiar with us, and pretends rather love and kindneſs, than any hurt to us (for in all ſin there is a deceitfulneſs) and we taking no heed to the Sword in its hand,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.13.</note> to its malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant killing-nature, but ſlighting it, as if it were venial, are deſtroy'd by it.</p>
               <p>And there are three Reaſons why we are ſo apt to over-look ſins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Conſcience doth not ſo ſoon cheek us for them, as for ſins of Commiſsion. If a man commit Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Adultery, or Theft, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53132:93"/> is ready to flie in his face, and thunder in his ears, as it did with <hi>Cain,</hi> after the ſlaughter of his Brother, that he cried out, <hi>My puniſhment is greater than I can bear;</hi> and he went up and down trembling (as ſome think) all his days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13, 14. But men may neglect Praying, or Reading, or Charity, eſpecially in regard of the manner of doing them, and Conſcience will take little notice of it. Such Omiſſions may paſs with little or no regard. <hi>Cain</hi> in the Offering he brought to God, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected (probably) to bring the beſt of the fruit of the ground, however to offer it with an upright believing heart; but we read not that he took notice of theſe Omiſſions, though he did of God's manifeſt diſreſpecting his Offering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. It's ordinary with ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men, if they fall into ill Company ſometime by accident, and are made drunk, to be aſhamed of it, and much troubled for it; but theſe men can live in their Families without Prayer and Scripture, and neglect to teach their Children and Servants the ways of God; and yet theſe Omiſſions do not at all
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53132:93"/> diſturb them, they go up and down, and eat, and drink, and ſleep, as merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if they obeyed the whole Will of God. <hi>Job</hi> tells you of thoſe that bid <hi>God depart from them,</hi> that deſire not, nor endeavour to know him; that caſt off Prayer to him, and all his Service as fruitleſs; and yet theſe men, guilty of ſuch great and groſs Omiſſions, could take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ, and ſpend their days in wealth and mirth, <hi>Job</hi> 21.12, 13, 14, 15. Theſe Negative Sins are ſtill and ſilent, and make none or little noiſe in the ears of Conſcience. But poſitive ſins are more clamorous. We read of thoſe that were guilty of Bribery and Oppreſſion under their guiſe and maſk of Religion; and how they are ſtab'd and frighted? <hi>A dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound is in their Ears, trouble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh make them afraid. They believe not that they ſhall come out of darkneſs,</hi> Job 15.21, 22, 24, compared with 34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35. <hi>verſes.</hi> How many do we know in places where we live, who if they ſhould rob or wrong their Neighbours, would hardly enjoy any peace or quietneſs in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53132:94"/> their Spirits, who can live chearfully and contentedly day after day, nay year after year, while all this while they rob God of that Love, and Fear, and Truſt which they ow him in their hearts, and of that open Homage and Allegiance which they ow him in their Houſes.</p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe ſins of Commiſſion are moſt againſt natural light. In ſins of Omiſſion there is no ſuch actual diſturbance, by which the free contemplation of the mind is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as in ſins of Commiſſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide foul acts of Sin, as Uncleanneſs and Murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bring more ſhame, and cauſe more horrour, than bare neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of our Duty. Conſcience is not wont to take any great notice of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal neglects, or of ſpiritual defects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are the more prone to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look, and take no notice of ſins of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; (as Conſcience is leſs troubled for them, ſo) our Chriſtian Friends are not ſo apt to warn and admoniſh us of them, as of ſins of Commiſſion. If a Profeſſor fall into ſome groſs ſin of Commiſsion; as if he be over-taken with intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or lying, or going beyond his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53132:94"/> Neighbour: All the Town or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood rings of it, his Chriſtian Friends hear and take notice of it, and out of love to his, and faithfulneſs to their own Souls, admoniſh him of it, and endeavour with the Spirit of meekneſs to bring him to repentance for it. But this Profeſſor may neglect prayer in his Cloſet, reading and meditating on the Word of God, examining his own heart; nay, poſſibly prayer in his Family, and the inſtruction of thoſe committed to his Charge in the Principles of Religion, and his Friends be wholly ignorant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo be all their days wanting to acquaint him with his ſin herein. When <hi>David</hi> had been guilty of ſeveral ſins of Commiſsion in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> hears of it, (for it ſeems to be the Town-talk, in that it's ſaid, <hi>That he cauſed the Enemies of God to blaſpheme,</hi> verſ. 14. And I ſuppoſe Gods Narration of it to him was rather a Command, or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the manner of his reprehenſion of <hi>David,</hi> than of certifying him of that he was ignorant before,) he goeth to him, and tells him thereof, and calls him to Repentance for them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53132:95"/> 1, <hi>to</hi> 10. But though <hi>David</hi> in all this time (likely nine moneths, for the Child was born, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.) had been guilty of many Omiſſions, in not confeſſing his ſin with ſorrow and ſhame, in not begging pardon with Faith and Hope, and in ſeveral other particulars; yet <hi>Nathan</hi> takes no notice thereof in his Speech to him, neither makes any mention of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are the more prone to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look ſins of Omiſſion, becauſe they are ſo near akin to Intermiſſions, which are lawful and neceſſary. Affirmative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts (as was ſaid before) do not bind <hi>ad ſemper;</hi> I am bound to pray in my Cloſet and Family every day, but I am not bound to pray in either all the day. God commands me to mind the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refreſhing my Body, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my particular Calling, and as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is to viſit the Fatherleſs and Afflicted; now becauſe theſe Intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Omiſsions, for a time are allowed and commanded, men are apt to turn them, or to fall from them, into total Omiſsions, and when they do ſo, to be little troubled for them. Becauſe men
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53132:95"/> may be excuſed from ſolemn religious Duties three parts or more of the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, therefore they will neglect them altogether, and are inſenſible of their neglect. Commiſsions being never law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for the Negative Commands bind <hi>ad ſemper;</hi> therefore if men be guilty of them, they take the more notice of them, and lay them more to heart; but poſitive Precepts being ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, and binding but at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Duties of them are to be performed but at ſome time) when inſtead of our intermiſſion there be an omiſsion, we are ready to wink at it, and regard it at moſt but as an Infirmity, which may require a pardon of courſe. If I may omit Prayer and Scripture ten hours of the day, ſaith the ſubtle wicked heart of man, why not eleven hours? and if eleven hours, what great hurt if it be omitted twelve hours? <hi>i. e.</hi> the whole day, and the Duty be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at all.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> The Reaſons why ſins of Omiſſion are damnable.</head>
               <p>I Come now to the third thing to be ſpoken to in the explication of this Doctrine, and that is to give the Reaſons why Chriſt will condemn men at the Great Day to eternal Torments for Sins of Omiſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Reaſons of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Why ſins of Omiſſion are damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> 1. The great and grand Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Sins. Every ſin is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>The wages of ſin</hi> (as ſin) <hi>is death,</hi> Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> Therefore theſe Omiſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins as well as Commiſſions, muſt of neceſsity be damnable to our Souls. As there is bitterneſs in every Sprig or Branch of Wormwood, and ſaltneſs in every drop or ſpoonful of Sea-water; ſo there is Death and Hell, and Wrath and Damnation in every Sin. The wicked Papiſts diſtinguiſh Sins into
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53132:96"/> Venial and Mortal, but they got that diſtinction from the Devil, not from God; they have their ſeven deadly ſins; But the Holy Ghoſt tells us, All ſins are deadly, without any diſtinction, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Though one Sin may be greater and more hainous than another, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin is mortal. A Piſtol is leſs than a Muſket, and a Muſket than a Canon; but they are all of them killing; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>The Soul that ſins ſhall die.</hi> Under the word <hi>death</hi> is comprehended all the miſery of this and the other World. Sin being a contempt of the Authority, a violation of the Law, and a ſlighting the Love of an infinite God, deſerves all that privation of Good, and infliction of Evil which this Sentence of Chriſt includes, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> God cannot inflict a greater puniſhment, nor can a finite limited Creature bear greater Torments than Sin (being of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite demerit) requires and calls for.</p>
               <p>Now I have largely proved, that Omiſsions are ſins as well as Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and to ſpeak properly and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is no ſin but the ſin of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ion.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53132:97"/> For even in Commiſsions, their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs conſiſteth in their want of that goodneſs which the Law requireth. Were there not a deficiency in them of ſomewhat which they ought to have, or a want of conformity to the Law, there would be no ſin in them. Yea, I have proved ſins of Omiſsion in ſome reſpect greater ſins, as more againſt the Mind of the Law-giver, (whoſe Will conſiſts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Affirmative than Negative part of the Command) and as the ground of ſins of Commiſsion, and as more directly againſt the Goſpel than ſins of Commiſsion. They are much miſtaken, who judge Omiſſions pure Privations, or meer Negations little other than non-entities; for Omiſsions are tranſgreſſions of an Affirmative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and violations of a poſitive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and the greateſt Contradictions to the Mind of the Law, and therefore moſt juſtly liable to its Curſe. The Apoſtle tells us what Obedience the Law requireth, and what the Condition of ſuch as fail therein is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. 1. It requireth practical Obedience, not hearing, or knowing, or ſpeaking only
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53132:97"/> of what is written in the Book of the Law, but doing it; <hi>To do them.</hi> It's doing that the Law requireth, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> &amp;c. And it's doers that the Law juſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Not the hearers of the Law, but the doers thereof ſhall be justified.</hi> Now under this doing, ſins of Omiſsion are expreſly forbidden, and thoſe Duties (the neglect of which are ſins of Omiſſion) are commanded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It requireth perſonal Obedience, <hi>Every one.</hi> It takes no notice of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by a Proxy, or a Surety, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it in our own perſons. The Law admits not a Mediator.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Perfect Obedience; <hi>In every thing written in the Book of the Law.</hi> It will not admit of the leaſt deviation, of any one ſtep awry, but preſently curſeth and condemneth for them. If any thought, word or deed, be never ſo little too light, it will not grant the leaſt grain of allowance, but damneth for them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It muſt be perpetual; <hi>That conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not.</hi> If in one day, one hour, one moment of his life he fail, he is undone. If a man could be obedient to the whole Law all the time of his life, and ſhould
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53132:98"/> in his dying-hour diſobey it; the Law would take no notice of all his former Obedience, but ſent him to Hell for his latter Diſobedience. For mark the ſtate of thoſe that yield not this perfect, perſonal, perpetual, practical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Their Condition is curſed; <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> In the word <hi>curſed,</hi> all evil is included. So that Omiſſions, or the neglect of thoſe Duties which the Law requireth, being ſins, they render the Creature liable to the Curſe, which is indeed all manner of miſery here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>Death and Hell are the end of every Sin, though they are not the end of every Sinner; they are the reward of every evil Work, though not the reward of every evil Worker. Free Grace in the blood of Chriſt doth ſometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and put in an Exception to this general Rule. The Goſpel accepted and pleaded, is a bar to thoſe rigorous proceedings of the Law. Therefore though this Reaſon will juſtifie Chriſt, and condemn the Sinner in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53132:98"/> of his own Conſcience, (eſpecially this Sinner being under a Covenant of Works) yet I ſhall give farther Reaſons from the Sinners non-intereſt in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt will condemn men at the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> laſt day to eternal Torments, for ſins of Omiſſion, becauſe they ſpeak a man in a carnal, natural eſtate. The Goſpel, that is the only Ark for a Chriſtian to ſhelter his Soul in, againſt the Flood of the Laws Curſes, requireth a change of the nature and diſpoſition, as abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation. Chriſt, the great Preacher and Purchaſer of the Goſpel, affirmeth ſolemnly, <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he ſhall never ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.3. This is indiſpenſably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, not only as a condition without which Heaven may not be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods pleaſure, but alſo as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition without which Heaven or Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs cannot be enjoy'd in regard of the ſubject. For 'tis this that is meant by our being <hi>made meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. Again, the Holy Ghoſt tells
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53132:99"/> us, <hi>That without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. This holineſs as a due qualification of the Agent in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the beatifical Viſion or ſight of God, the bleſſed-making Object, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by the Goſpel. How often are the Unregenerate and unſanctified by the Spirit of God doomed to Hell, and excluded Heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. <hi>Into it can in no wiſe enter any thing that is defiled or unclean.</hi> Again, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. Implying, that Death and Deſtruction are the portion of the Unconverted.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Sins of Omiſsion are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of a mans want of Regeneration. Nay, there is much more evil in a ſtate of Sin, than in an act of Sin; which ſtate of Sin conſiſteth moſt in Sins of Omiſsion. For this was the great evil and miſery of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> by nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That they were without God, i. e.</hi> were without any inward regard of him, or outward Obedience to him. Sound Converſion and ſaving Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance make clear work, as the Flood drown'd all out of the Ark, <hi>Noahs</hi> Friends as well as others. So Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53132:99"/> deſtroys all ſins, even ſins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as well as Commiſſion. It loves none, it allows of none. Reſtraining Grace will probably refuſe the way of Diſobedience, but renewing Grace will cloſe the way of Obedience. Thoſe that are in a wicked and unregenerate ſtate, are characterized in Scripture from their ſins of Omiſſion. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his heart will not ſeek after God: God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10.4. <hi>The Lord hath a controverſie with the Land, becauſe there is no Mercy, nor Truth, nor Knowledge of God in the Land,</hi> Hoſ. 4.1. Nay, the reign of Sin (which ever ſpeaks an unconverted and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eſtate) is as viſible, if not more in Omiſſions than in Commiſſions. As there is as high an act of Authority, and Soveraignty, and Princely Power in a Negative Voice, or denying ſuch and ſuch things to be done as in a poſitive Law, enjoyning ſuch and ſuch things to be done. So the omiſſion of what is good, or refuſing to do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, may ſpeak Sin reigning in the Soul, as well as doing, or commanding to be done what God hath forbidden.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53132:100"/> It is indeed the judgment of many, that a Princes Negative Voice is a greater part and mark of his Royalty, than any Affirmative Command of his; for a King may have Power to Command, that which he hath no Power to forbid. As he may and ſhould enjoyn his Subjects to Worſhip the true God, according to his revealed Will; but he hath no Power to forbid them. Thus in Sins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for a man to live without Prayer, without the love and fear of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delight in him, and communion with him, without care of, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over his own heart and life, may be a greater ſign of the reign of Sin, and thereby of an unregenerate ſtate, than the commiſſion of ſome groſs actual Tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>It is apparent, that this man is under the power of Luſt, as a Servant to it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. <hi>And under the dominion of the Devil, carried captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.26. And an unregenerate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified perſon, becauſe he lives in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to theſe poſitive Laws of God. <hi>Whereas he that is born of God ſinneth not,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. with his whole
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53132:100"/> will; there is not a free, voluntary, chearful ſubmiſſion of his Will to the quiet, undiſturbed dominion of Sin. And he that is born of God hath a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the whole Law. <hi>I have eſteemed thy Precepts concerning all things to be right; therefore I hate every falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119.128. He hath reſpect to Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as well as Negative Precepts: He hath an equal uniform regard to all the Law, to that part which commands the doing good, as well as that part which forbids the doing evil. Therefore the man that lives in Sins of Omiſsion, is not born of God, and therefore uncapable by the Goſpel of Heaven; and ſo juſtly for this cauſe ſentenced to Hell.</p>

               <p>As Salvation is God's Gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> ſo it's Chriſts Purchaſe. <hi>There is no Name under Heaven whereby men may be ſaved, but by the Name of Chriſt,</hi> Act. 4.12. So that all who are without Chriſt, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in him, muſt of neceſſity periſh. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.12. Thoſe that are without Chriſt are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned; <hi>All their ſins are imputed to them,</hi> Epheſ. 4. ult. Rom. 3.25. And where-ever ſin is imputed, it condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.3. Thoſe that are not intereſted in Chriſt, are Children of the Devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. and Children of wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2, 3. And ſuch Children muſt be with their Father the Devil, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrath for ever.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe that live in Sins of Omiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have no intereſt in Chriſt. Our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and ſo in Life, is by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53132:101"/> Faith. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live by Faith in the Son of God.</hi> It is Faith that cauſeth the Union between Chriſt and the Soul, and joyns them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; by virtue of which Union, the Chriſtian hath communion with Chriſt in his Merits and Righteouſneſs, that his Life, and Death, and Burial are the Chriſtians, are by God imputed to him, as if performed in his own perſon: Hence it's ſaid, That the Chriſtian lives with Chriſt, is crucified with Chriſt, and buried with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. And the Chriſtian is ſaid <hi>to be the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. ult. By this Union with Chriſt, which is the fruit of Faith, the Chriſtian is <hi>made a Son of God,</hi> Gal. 3.26. <hi>and ſo an Heir of God, and Joynt-Heir with Christ,</hi> Rom. 8.17. As a Woman by marriage being united and made one with a Man, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in his Relations, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Eſtate So the Chriſtian by Faith made one with Chriſt, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in his Relations. <hi>Go tell my Brethren, I go to my Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:53132:102"/> Joh. 20.17. In his Eſtate, <hi>Chriſt is Heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1.2. and the <hi>Believer is a Joynt-Heir with him,</hi> as is before proved. Chriſt was the Firſt-born among many Brethren, and ſo the Inheritance did belong to him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. Believers are a Congregation of firſt-born, and ſo the right of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is theirs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. But ſuch as live in ſins of Omiſsion are without Faith, and therefore without Chriſt, and therefore muſt be without Heaven for ever. Faith is a ſanctifying as well as a juſtifying Grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>And to give them an Inheritance among them that are ſanctified through Faith in Chriſt,</hi> and therefore will not ſuffer the Soul to live in any ſin.</p>
               <p>Faith will not ſuffer a man to live in the want of love to God, in ſo great an Omiſsion; for when Faith certifieth the Soul of Gods love to it, this kindleth in the Soul flames of love to God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. When Faith brings much fewel, the fire of love will be great. Faith will not ſuffer a man to live without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The eye of Faith which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds a Chriſt crucified for ſin, affects
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53132:102"/> the heart with ſorrow for, and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt thoſe ſins that crucified him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced, and mourn.</hi> Faith will not ſuffer a man to live without delight in Chriſt, and rejoycing in the God of all Conſolation. Faith ſeeth ſo much good certainly laid up in the Covenant and Promiſes for the Soul, that it fills the Soul with joy in the hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the enjoyment of them. <hi>Whom having not ſeen, we love: and in whom believing, though now we ſee him not, we rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7, 8. Faith will not ſuffer a man to live without waiting qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly on God. Faith will not limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but patiently ſtay Gods time for the mercies the Soul wanteth. Faith knoweth his Bonds are good, his Debts are in ſure Hands: <hi>The God that cannot lye hath promiſed,</hi> Tit. 1.2. and therefore is not haſty to call them in. <hi>He that believeth will not make haſte,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. Faith will not ſuffer a man to live without prayer. He that knows his own wants and neceſſities, how great and urgent they are, and alſo where he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53132:103"/> may quickly have liberal Supplies, and bountiful Relief will not long be kept from that Door. You may ſooner and eaſier put off a Beggar ready to ſtarve, (who muſt needs periſh, if Charity do not help him,) and perſwade him never to aſk Alms more, as keep a Believer from his daily waiting at Heavens Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to aſk ſpiritual Alms. An Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath little hope to ſpeed, and therefore little heart to ſpeak. But a Believer hath taſted God to be gracious, and received many a bleſſing upon his knees, and therefore cannot but know that Door again, at which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo good, ſo large Doles. He knoweth that whatſoever he aſketh, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, in the Name of Chriſt, ſhall be granted him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.14. Hereby he is encouraged to beg and aſk. <hi>I believed, therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.10. I believed, ſaith the Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I wept, and pray'd, and made ſupplication, and have prevailed.</p>
               <p>Faith will not ſuffer a man to live without Scripture. The Word of God is the Food of Faith, and a man can as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53132:103"/> well live without Bread, as Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. It's Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that breeds Faith; <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. And it's Scripture that feeds Faith, and helps it to thrive; <hi>I hope in thy Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.114. Hope is a degree of Faith. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh thy Word unto thy Servant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to truſt.</hi> Thus I might ſhew how inconſiſtent other Sins of Omiſsion are with Faith; and therefore they who live in ſuch ſins, muſt be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and ſo obnoxious to the wrath of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> But I ſhall conclude this Head with this Note, that Faith is obediential, and therefore it's impoſſible for a Believer to live in Diſobedience to God's poſitive Laws. We read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Obedience of Faith.</p>
               <p>Faith in the Promiſes works Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Precepts. <hi>As 'tis impoſſible without Faith to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. So 'tis impoſſible with Faith not to deſire to pleaſe him. The Diſobedient and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers are joyn'd together.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53132:104"/> and Unbelievers, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.51. Others, as younger Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, receive their part of wrath under them as the Heirs. They are the great Owners of Hell, the chief Landlords of the Valley of Death; others do as it were hold from and under them. So <hi>the Hypocrite in heart heaps up wrath.</hi> The Hypocrite in heart. Hypocriſie lies cloſe in the heart, as the Juglers tools, out of ſight. As in the Cellar, under the Parliament, there was nothing to be ſeen but what was lawful and allowable, Coals and Wood, fit Proviſion for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But when theſe were taken away, and the Cellar was ſearched to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, then the Barrels of Powder ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and the Coals and Wood were diſcover'd to be fewel laid in for the Devils Kitchin. So, many perſons who are unblamable (as we ſay) in their lives, walk without offence, are nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively holy, theſe ſeem to be good men, &amp; approved; but if we ſearch them further to the bottom, their Hypocriſie appears, that all this was for vain-glory, or ſome carnal intereſt; they heap up wrath, and ſhall have that wrath which is ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53132:105"/> that Hell is called by that Name, in great meaſure; or he himſelf by his Hypocriſie is daily filling up that Cup of Wrath which he muſt drink of eternally. An hypocritical Nation are the people of Gods wrath, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.5, 6. whom he appoints to ruine. They go about to mock God, as they do men; but they deceive themſelves, God is not mocked. They do as thoſe who uſe much art to hide the wrinkles and defects of Nature, but God can ſee <hi>Jezabel</hi> under all her paint, and find out the Wife of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> notwithſtanding her diſguiſe, and will puniſh the Diſſembler with the Lake of Fire; and then what ſhall become of the Profeſſor? All that love and make a lye are doomed to that Dungeon of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Hypocriſie is the loudeſt lye that ever was told, becauſe it is given to God himſelf. It may be ſaid to every Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite as <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Thou haſt lyed not to man, but to God,</hi> Act. 5.4. For he tells God, and would make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he forbears groſs Sins, and is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively holy, becauſe it's his Will, when he neglects his poſitive Precepts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath diſcover'd moſt of his Will.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53132:105"/> Now ſuch as live in Omiſſions, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their Profeſſion, and all their negative Piety, are but Juglers and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers. They who are partial in their holineſs, are not ſound at heart. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obeys any Command out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, will endeavour Obedience to every Command. <hi>David</hi> is approved for his Integrity, from the univerſality of his Obedience, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.8. So <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are declared righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, <hi>i. e.</hi> upright, <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the Statutes and Commandments of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> Luk. 1.6. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs makes no baulks in the field of Divine Precepts. Were not this man who lives in Omiſſions unſound, he would fear Omiſsions as much as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions; for ſincerity hates every evil way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.104. and he would be careful to obey Affirmative as well as Negative Commands; for uprightneſs, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath the whole Law in its hands; nay, written in its heart, and expounded in its life. But this man, who like a Globons body, toucheth the Law of God in ſome one point, but meets not in the reſt, ſheweth plainly that he is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53132:106"/> hollow within, as your Globes are. For obſerve it, if this man were ſincere, and acted upon conſcientious grounds, then thoſe pious Reaſons upon which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears ſins of Commiſsion, would incline him to take heed of ſins of Omiſſion. If he forbear Commiſsions, becauſe they are againſt the Will of God, (which ſhould be the main ground of all Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5, 6.) then he would alſo take heed of Omiſſions, becauſe they are as much againſt the Will of God as Commiſsions. If the Authority of God were that which ſway'd him in his Negative, the ſame would move him to poſitive holineſs; for there is the ſame authority in Negative and in Poſitive Precepts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. The ſame God that ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt be diligent to know the ſtate of thy flock; And thou ſhalt give to him that asketh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if this man abſtains from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions, becauſe they diſhonour God; he would alſo take heed of Omiſſions, for they diſhonour God alſo. Every breach of the Law is a diſhonour to the Law-giver, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23, 24. Further,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53132:106"/> if he forbear Commiſsions, becauſe he is redeemed from them with the blood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. of Chriſt, he would take heed of Omiſsions; for Chriſt did not only redeem from Sin, but alſo unto Service, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Once more, if he did forbear Commiſſions, becauſe they are injurious to his own Soul, and deprive him of Heaven and Happineſs; then he would take heed of Omiſsions, for they are as deſtructive to his Soul, and will as certainly hinder it of Heaven, as the Text aſſureth us. So that upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever conſcientious grounds he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears Commiſſions, he would upon the ſame grounds take heed of Omiſſions, which he not doing, proclaims himſelf an Hypocrite, and as ſuch, is moſt juſtly condemned to die eternally. He that forbears ſin from a Principle of Grace, will be as careful to do good, as to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from evil. Reſtraining Grace mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much the omiſſion of good, but renewing Grace or Holineſs in Truth cannot allow it. Such a man chooſeth

               <p n="1">1. Theſe Sinners who are guilty of theſe groſs Commiſſions, are guilty of Omiſſions alſo: They have the weight of both ſorts of ſins to preſs them to Hell. A man may be guilty of Omiſsions, as not to believe, not to pray, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his own Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet be free from groſs Commiſsions; he may be no Lyar, no Thief, no Oppreſſor, no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, no Adulterer, at leaſt in regard of the outward acts which I intend here: But a man cannot live in groſs Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but he muſt alſo live in Omiſſions; the Oppreſſor muſt omit to relieve the poor. He that deſtroys life, muſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53132:109"/> to ſave it. Beſides, they who live in ſuch Commiſſions muſt omit Faith and Repentance, which are inconſiſtent with them; they muſt neglect daily to call on God, for prayer would make them leave ſuch ſinning; but indeed ſuch ſinning makes them leave of (though poſſibly they did ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſeek God in a formal way,) pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thoſe in the 5. of <hi>James,</hi> who oppreſſed the Labourers, who condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and killed the juſt, (groſs Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) had their Riches corrupted, and Garments moth-eaten, <hi>i. e.</hi> were guilty of Omiſſions, would rather their wealth ſhould waſte with ruſt, and their Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with moths, than beſtow any on the Poor. Thoſe in the 4. of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1, 2. who were guilty of Swearing and Lying, and Killing, and Stealing, and Adultery, omitted Truth, and Mercy, and the Knowledge of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sins of Commiſſion (I mean thoſe groſs Crimes) do more openly dare God than Omiſſions do. By Omiſſions we deny him, but by ſuch Commiſſions we dare him, and defie him. Such Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as it were, bid God do his worſt,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53132:110"/> they fear him not. They do (at leaſt implicitly) mock at his Threatnings, and deride his Reproofs, and ſlight his Judgments that are executed on their Fellows before their own faces. They ſpeak in the Language of the <hi>Jews, Iſa.</hi> 5.19. <hi>That ſay, Let him make ſpeed and haſten his work, that we may ſee it, and let the Counſel of the holy One of</hi> Iſrael <hi>draw nigh and come, that we may know it.</hi> Theſe jear at Gods Judgments, and mock at his Menaces; they credit not his Comminations, nor expect their Execution. They look on the words of their Prophets as meer wind, and the matter of their Propheſie as a meer mockery. <hi>Let him make ſpeed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Counſel of the holy One of</hi> Iſrael <hi>draw nigh,</hi> i. e. you have much and long told us, that your holy One, forſooth, who cannot abide ſin, <hi>and who is of purer eyes then to behold Iniquity,</hi> will execute his Judgments on us for our ſins, and that this is by Counſel eſtabliſhed, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reverſed; we would willingly ſee theſe Judgments ſo much talked of, and do wiſh that they may haſten, and not linger as they do; for we neither
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53132:110"/> believe you, nor fear them. But who were theſe who ſpake at this deſperate rate? truly thoſe that lived in Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>who brought forth wild Grapes,</hi> Iſa. 5.4. who brought forth filthy, naughty, abominable fruit; in ſtead of Grapes, the Vineyard brought forth Thorns and Briars: Theſe were they who dared the Divine Juſtice, as if they had been incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Devils.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Groſs ſins of Commiſſion are more directly contrary to the very light of Nature. Indeed it is againſt the light of Nature not to feed the Hungry, and cloath the Naked, and help the Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but it's much more againſt the light of Nature to oppreſs the Poor and Needy, and ſlay the Widow and Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Becauſe natural light is much more diſturbed by groſs Commiſsions than by bare Neglects; it appears, that thoſe are more againſt a natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than theſe.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53132:111"/> and how Vengeance, like a Blood-Hound, did purſue the violent man, to take and ſlay him, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.4. Now that which ſo directly oppoſeth not only Scripture, but Nature, and that which a man will do (as it were) violence to his own Conſcience that he may commit, muſt unqueſtionably be dreadful, and out of meaſure ſinful. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> James 4.17. <hi>ult.</hi> So ſay I to him that knoweth he ſhould not do theſe evils, and doth them, to him they are ſins, <hi>i. e.</hi> a wickedneſs with a witneſs. They have more of enmity againſt God, and contempt of his Mind, and have ſadder marks of Divine Vengeance. But what ſins are more againſt knowledge, than thoſe that are not only committed in ſpight of Scripture, but alſo of Nature it ſelf. No Vinegar ſo ſharp, as that which is made of the ſharpeſt Wine. <hi>He that knoweth his Maſters Will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> He that knoweth his Maſters Will, is, that he ſhould forbear ſuch ſins, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:53132:111"/>4. Groſs ſins of Commiſsion are more ſcandalous to men, and bring more diſhonour to God. They give greater offence to men, good men are grieved by them. <hi>Lots</hi> righteous Soul was vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the unclean converſation of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Rivers of Tears ran down his eyes, becauſe the wicked broke Gods Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> wept in ſecret for the ſins of <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 13.17. Wicked mens ſins cauſe godly mens ſorrow. They need not diſturb the Righteous by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of them, they do it ſufficiently by their Tranſgreſsions againſt God. As theſe groſs ſins grieve the good, ſo they harden the bad: Others are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to dreſs themſelves by ſuch foul and falſe Glaſſes.<note place="margin">Jer. 23.14.</note> Vile Sinners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their ſtates good though their lives be bad, becauſe they are no worſe than ſuch and ſuch, (poſsibly who are learned, and rich, and therefore counted wiſe men,) and therefore whatever befals them, they ſhall fare as well as others. Alas how many walk more by Patterns than by Commands, and ſo are led by following others to Hell! And how
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53132:112"/> deep will they be damned, who draw others after them to Sin and Hell? They who forſake the Law, praiſe the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.4. i. e. commend them for their wickedneſs, as they who keep the Law condemn them. Groſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion diſhonour God moſt; they cauſe others to ſpeak ill of God, and diſgracefully of Religion. <hi>Nathan</hi> tells <hi>David,</hi> That by his Uncleanneſs and Murder, <hi>He had cauſed the Enemies of God to blaſpheme,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. If a Child of God commit one ſuch noiſome act, the wicked quickly take the ſcent, and a Cry is raiſed among the whole Pack, who with open mouth upon this purſue and blaſpheme God and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. By theſe particulars it appears, that groſs Commiſsions are ſins of the greateſt ſize, and therefore muſt have the greateſt ſeverity. If they are uſed as Baſtards who met not <hi>Iſrael</hi> with bread and water, how will God uſe them at laſt who meet his people with Bonds and Fetters, with Fire and Fagot? If Chriſt pronounce ſuch a dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Text againſt the (Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) <hi>green Tree, what ſhall become of the dry?</hi>

               <p>IN the ſecond place,<note place="margin">Second uſe of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> If Chriſt will condemn men at the Great Day for ſins of Omiſſion, it may inform us, that a negative Religion, or negative Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, is not enough. Many pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are Gracious, becauſe they are not openly Vicious; and that they are Pious, becauſe they are not ſcandalouſly Prophane; but they miſtake and deceive themſelves. It is good not to do evil, but it is evil not to do good. Negative Chriſtians are as it was ſaid of <hi>Galba, Potius extra vitia quam cum vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute:</hi> Rather ſeemingly free from Vice, than really filled with Virtue. Or at beſt, as was reported of <hi>Cato,</hi> That he was <hi>homo virtuti ſimillimus,</hi> A man that looked like a virtuous perſon.</p>
               <p>How many civil men preſume their perſons holy, becauſe they are not ſo filthy as thoſe who rake in Ditches and Kennels, and defile themſelves daily
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53132:113"/> with ſcandalous Abominations; and they preſume their ſtates to be good, and themſelves in the way to Heaven, becauſe they are no Drunkards, no Swearers, no Adulterers, no Theeves, no Murderers; when for all this they ſhall be caſt to Hell, becauſe they are no Believers, no Penitents, no obedient Subjects to the King of Saints, <hi>Becauſe they know not God, and obey not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8. Such men are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtant from good than from evil. Ceaſing from evil is not enough, it's but one ſtep Heaven-ward; doing of good muſt accompany it, or it will be of ſmall moment.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, when I behold a civil man, who is harmleſs in his Carriage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable (in regard of ſcandal) in his publick Converſation, and courteous in his Behaviour to all; I cannot but reſpect him, and am ready to wiſh (as <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that all the World of Atheiſts and prophane Wretches would turn Hypocrites) that all ſcandalous Sinners would turn Civilians, and come ſo far towards Holineſs; but yet I muſt ſay, that this is ſcarce half way to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53132:113"/> He is not half a Saint, who is but a negative Saint. The forbearance of groſs Corruptions is the eaſieſt and leaſt part of Religion, and therefore will not ſpeak any man in a ſtate of Salvation. The Tree that is barren, and without good fruit, is for the fire, as well as the Tree that brings forth evil fruit.</p>
               <p>For men to think to excuſe themſelves that they do no hurt, wrong neither Man, Woman, or Child, and are not (as the Phariſee ſaid) as the Publicans, who generally were Oppreſſors, is but a vain fooliſh thing. The idle Servant might have ſaid, Lord, I did no harm with my Talent, I did not lay it out in Rioting and Drunkenneſs, or any way to thy diſhonour; I only hid it, and did not improve it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. yet this was enough to condemn him. Can we call ground good ground, for bearing no weeds, if it never bring forth good Corn? Or do we count that Servant a good Servant, who doth not wrong his Maſter in his Eſtate, by purloining or waſting it, if he live idle all day, and neglect the buſineſs his Maſter appoints him. Believe it, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou mayſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53132:114"/> not be morally evil to the abomination of men, and yet not ſpiritually good to the acceptation of God. He keeps no Law of God, who minds only the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative part of it. A life free from enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is too often accompanied with an heart full of iniquity. And that this negative Holineſs is inſufficient, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Holy Ghoſt characterizeth a godly man both negatively and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. The Scripture tells us, That a true Chriſtan minds both parts of the Law, its commanding part as well as its forbidding part. When the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of <hi>Davids</hi> goodneſs, he tells us, That he ſerved the Wills of God in his Generation, not only his forbidding-will, but alſo his commanding-will, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.36. When <hi>Job</hi> is commended as a godly man, he is ſaid <hi>to eſchew evil,</hi> there was his negative Holineſs; and <hi>to fear God,</hi> there was his poſitive Holineſs, <hi>Job</hi> 1.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> deſcribes the happy man by his holineſs both ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of Negation, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the Counſel of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly,</hi> (i. e. that committeth not
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53132:114"/> wickedneſs, which is the conſultation of the Ungodly,) <hi>nor ſtandeth in the way of Sinners,</hi> (i. e. that goeth not on with pleaſure in any courſe of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,) <hi>nor ſitteth in the Seat of the ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> (i. e. that hardneth not not his heart againſt advice and admonition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of Poſition, <hi>But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in that Law doth he meditate day and night.</hi> His af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Law, and his meditation in it are both poſitive; and without theſe the man could neither be holy nor happy. He might have been able to ſay, <hi>I have not walked in the Counſel of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, nor ſtood in the way of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not ſate in the Seat of the ſcornful;</hi> and yet been a wicked and curſed man; for Negatives neither ſpeak nor make any man holy. It is a poſitive quality, that gives being, perfection, and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Piety. Therefore <hi>Jehu</hi> is bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a wicked man, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his zeal againſt <hi>Baal,</hi> becauſe he took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.29, 30, 31. Philoſophers tell us, That motions are imperfect, and but in <hi>fieri,</hi> whilſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53132:115"/> they are paſſing from the <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> and are not perfect, or <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> till the <hi>Terminus ad quem</hi> be attained. Whilſt a man is departing from evil, he is but an imperfect Chriſtian; when he comes to the doing of good, which is the end of the former, then he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law, which is the Rule of Religion, is Affirmative as well as Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Every man is ſo far perfect in his Calling, or in any Art, as he agrees with his Rule. And every man is ſo far reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious (and no farther) as he agreeth with the Will of God revealed in his Word, which is the Rule of Religion; <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>As many as walk according to this Rule, peace be to them,</hi> &amp;c. Now this Rule hath Poſitive as well as Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commands. Nay, all its Negative Commands have (as hath been ſhewn before) ſomewhat poſitive in them, and therefore negative holineſs cannot be ſufficient. He that makes not Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every part of Gods Will, makes Conſcience of no part of Gods Will. <hi>He that denieth ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> becauſe the Law, his Rule, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53132:115"/> them, <hi>will alſo live righteouſly, ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and godly,</hi> becauſe the ſame Rule commands them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. Indeed all true eſchewing of evil doth proceed out of love to good; ſo that he who doth not delight in good, and do it, cannot eſchew evil out of any good Principle. Obſerve the Rule, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>And be renewed in the Spirit of your mind. And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and true holineſs. Iſa.</hi> 1.15. But men love to be compleat in every thing, but that which deſerves exactneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An Heathen may be negatively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. A <hi>Cato,</hi> a <hi>Seneca,</hi> an <hi>Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> may be free from Intemperance, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, Injuſtice, Uncleanneſs, and all groſs ſins; and can we think that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſufficient for us which Heathens may attain to. Is there nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Sun-light of Scripture for us to do, which they were unable to ſee by the dim Ruſh-candle of Nature. The Holy Ghoſt acquaints us with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Heathen, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That they were without God, without Chriſt, ſtrangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53132:116"/> aliens from the Commonwealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and without hope in the World.</hi> In which words we have their dreadful eſtate, how far they are from any Saviour, and ſo from any hope of Salvation; which would not be, if their negative holineſs were ſufficient to make them happy.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Third Uſe of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note>3. If Chriſt will condemn men for ſins of Omiſſion at the Great Day, then it may inform us of the Juſtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt. It's ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That he loveth Righteouſneſs, and hateth Iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 45. And again, <hi>That he ſhall judge the world in Righteouſneſs,</hi> Act. 17.31. Herein it appears:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he ſpares no Sins. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth thoſe that live in Omiſſions (little light ſins in the imaginations of men) as well as thoſe that live in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. He ſends to Hell thoſe that do not relieve, as well as thoſe that rob his people. He poureth out his wrath upon them that do not viſit his Members in Priſon, as well as thoſe that caſt them into Priſon. Thoſe ſins that are Peccadil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes in the Worlds eye, have felt the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy weight of his hand. The man that gather'd a few ſticks, was deſtroy'd with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53132:116"/> ſtones. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> touch'd the Ark out of kindneſs, but God ſmote him with death for it. <hi>Moſes</hi> for omitting the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of his Child, was like to have loſt his life. <hi>Aarons</hi> two Sons, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> neglected (as is ſuppoſed by Expoſitors) to fetch fire from the Altar to burn their Sacrifices, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd with fire from Heaven, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. The impartiality of Chriſt is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent herein, that at the Great Day he will bid the Civil as well as the Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Sinner depart from him into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe he ſpareth no Sinners. He ſaith to all thoſe on his left hand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rich or Poor, Great or Small, High or Low, if guilty of theſe Omiſſions, <hi>Depart from me into everlaſting fire.</hi> He is no reſpecter of perſons, he ſpareth none for their greatneſs and ſtrength. His hand reacheth the talleſt Cedars, and plucks up the ſtrongeſt Oaks. Neither Power nor Majeſty can free or exempt perſons from his ſeverity. If Princes and Potentates will omit their Duty, they muſt expect to feel his Fury. <hi>Pharaoh, Jeroboam, Ahab, Ahaz,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 6.15,</note>

As all their ſins were within the view of his Omniſcience, ſo all their perſons were within the reach of his Vengeance, and that found them out to their coſt.</p>
               <p>He ſpareth none for their nearneſs to him. He beholdeth them afar off that are very near to him, when they make bold with him. Judges on Earth may ſometimes (though ſinfully always) favour their Kindred in an unrighteous cauſe, but he judgeth otherwiſe. <hi>Though</hi> Coniah <hi>be to be as the ſignet on my right hand, I will pluck him thence,</hi> Jer. 22.24. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was the neareſt people to God of any people in the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. <hi>ult.</hi> with <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7. and <hi>Moſes</hi> was the neareſt to God of any of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet they were excluded his Reſt, for not believing his Word; and he was denied entrance into <hi>Canaan,</hi> for not ſanctifying Gods Name.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He judgeth all according to Law. This is another requiſite to ſuffice: He will not condemn any for their Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53132:117"/> or Commiſſions, but according to Law. We count that Judge juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that keeps the Law, and will not upon any account ſwerve from that. Our Lord Jeſus, when he ſentenceth thoſe that neglect to feed the Hungry, and cloath the Naked, <hi>&amp;c. to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire,</hi> proceedeth according to Law exactly. Theſe perſons (as hath been before proved) are under the Law of Works, and ſo muſt ſtand or fall for ever, as they obey or diſobey that Law. Now that Law condemneth for Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not doing our Duties, as well as for Commiſſions, and abounding in enormities. It ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.13. Obſerve, the Law curſeth thoſe that omit, that continue not to do their Duties, as well as thoſe that do the contrary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He will render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Works. He may puniſh, and doth in this World leſs; but neither in the other nor in this more than our Inquities deſerve. All mens ſins are not equal, therefore all mens ſufferings ſhall
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53132:118"/> not be equal. According to the degree of mens defilements, ſuch ſhall be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their puniſhment. He diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth between ſins and ſins, between them that afflict his Children, and thoſe that relieve them not in their Afflictions; between thoſe that hale them to Priſons, and put them to death, and thoſe that viſit them not in priſon. He exacteth not of men more than is meet.</p>
               <p>He will put a difference between Heathens, who have little means to know and worſhip him aright, and <hi>Jews, To whom were committed the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, to whom pertained the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Covenant, and the giving of the Law, and the Promiſes.</hi> Theſe have greater Means and Mercies, and therefore greater Wrath and Severity. <hi>Tribulation and Anguiſh, Indignation and Wrath on the ſoul of every man that doth evil, on the</hi> Jew <hi>firſt, and alſo on the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>You only have I known, therefore you will I puniſh of all the Families of the Earth for your Iniquities,</hi> Amos 3.2. He will diſtinguiſh between <hi>Jews</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that live under the Goſpel. Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53132:118"/> are more tollerable, and leſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among <hi>Heathens</hi> than <hi>Jews,</hi> and among <hi>Jews</hi> before Chriſts coming, than thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that lived under the Goſpel, and ſaw Chriſt's Miracles, and heard his Sermons, with thoſe Chriſtians that enjoy the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21, 22, 23. It will be more tollerable for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> than for <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> and for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> than for <hi>Capernaum,</hi> becauſe theſe lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der greater Light and Helps, and yet continued in the neglect of Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>He will not puniſh thoſe that omit their Duties ignorantly (when they are diligent to improve what advantages they have for knowledge) ſo ſeverely as he will thoſe who neglect their Duties knowingly. God expects a life anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Light which he hath given us; and if we impriſon his Truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, we provoke him in the higheſt degree. <hi>He that knoweth his Maſters Will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. He that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes.</hi> Both
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53132:119"/> ſhall be beaten, but the former ſuffer more ſtripes than the latter. It's cold comfort, yet herein the Righteouſneſs of the Judge appeareth, that ſome who are guilty of Omiſſions ſhall have a cooler Hell than others; <hi>For he rendreth to every man according to his Works,</hi> Rom. 2.</p>

IF Chriſt will condemn men at the Great Day for Sins of Omiſſion, for not viſiting the Sick and Impriſoned, and not relieving the Hungry and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: Then it may inform us, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of practical godlineſs will ſpeak a mans eſtate ſafe at this Day, or fore-ſpeak his eſtate to be comfortable at that day. The want of this is the cauſe of theſe mens condemnation: They might forbear injuring the Saints, they might ſpeak them fair, bid them, <hi>Be ye fed, Be ye cloathed.</hi> They might wiſh them well, they might honour and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53132:119"/> reſpect them (as <hi>Herod</hi> did the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>) for their ſanctity and righteouſneſs, yet becauſe they were void of this practical godlineſs, they gave them not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be fed and cloathed; they are baniſhed the preſence of Chriſt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to the Curſes and Company of Devils.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A great Profeſſion will not do without this practical godlineſs. Some ſoar high in their Profeſſions of, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to greater ſtrictneſs, and degrees of Grace and Holineſs than others, who alas fall foully often on Earth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways into Hell, for lack of this practical godlineſs. As ſome great Tradeſmen, who living wholly upon their Credit with others, without any ſtock of their own, quickly break and miſcarry. A Profeſſion is but as the leaves of a Tree (a ſign of fruit) not the fruit it ſelf. There is a vaſt difference between leaves and fruit. Some think that Chriſt had not curſed the Fig-Tree, if it had been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaves as well as without fruit: But when by its leaves it profeſſed to have fruit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon, 1. <hi>part,</hi> 132</note> and invited him to it in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and diſappointed him, he
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53132:120"/> preſently claps a Curſe on it, that withers it at the very roots. The Phariſees were great Profeſſors, made broad their Philacteries, where-ever they went, would be known for perſons extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily pious and religious, yet how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked was their ſtate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Righteouſneſs exceed the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> and how woful is their Condition? <hi>Woe to you Scribes, Phariſees, Hypocrites,</hi> (ye live in Omiſſions) <hi>ye neglect the great things of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith,</hi> Matth. 23.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Great Gifts and Parts will not do without this. A man may have choice natural Abilities, rare acquired Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; yea, common Gifts of the Spirit of God, and yet for want of this practical godlineſs be damned. What amiable words come out of <hi>Balaams</hi> mouth, he ſpeaks like a Saint; yea like an Angel? how often have I heard his Propheſies, with great admiration and affection? his Tongue hath melted my heart; and yet he had no good works, for all his many good words; and his
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53132:120"/> lack of practical godlineſs ruin'd him. What ſpecial endowments had they who preached in the Name of Chriſt, <hi>and in his Name caſt out Devils, and in his Name did many marvailous works;</hi> and yet were caſt to Devils for being Workers of Iniquity, as all are who are void of this practical godlineſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 23. What excellent Gifts doth the Apoſtle ſuppoſe a man to have <hi>the gift of Propheſing, of underſtanding all My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and all Knowledge, and of all Faith, ſo as to remove Mountains, and yet if he have not Charity, he is nothing,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 13.2, 3. If he love not his Brother, and expreſs it not to his power, by ſpiritual and bodily Charity, (which is part of practical godlineſs) he is nothing in Gods Eye, what ever he may be in the eyes of men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Great Priviledges, with ſeeming performances, without this practical godlineſs, will not do. They who had Tabernacle, Temple, Ark, Covenant, Promiſes, for want of this were deſtoy'd; The Ark could not preſerve them. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when they nelected practical godlineſs, the Temple could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53132:121"/> them. He bids the <hi>Jews</hi> go and ſee what he did to his place at <hi>Shiloh</hi> for their Iniquities. He made them monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Fury, who had been pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of his Pity, when they neglected this practical godlineſs.</p>
               <p>How meanly doth God diſcourſe of ſeeming Obedience to his own Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when this is neglected. Though they had his own Divine ſtamp on them, and were ſigns of the ſweeteſt Sacrifice, and the moſt acceptable Service imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and he had often taken delight in them; yet when they left off to do well, obſerve his Language about them. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to me, ſaith the Lord, bring no more vain Oblations, Incenſe is an abomination to me: Your new Moons and your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Feaſts my Soul hateth, I cannot bear them.</hi> What ſtrange expreſſions are here of his own Inſtitutions? But what's the reaſon? Truly, the lack of this, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Learn to do well, ſeek Judgment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Oppreſſed, Judge the Fatherleſs, Plead for the Widow,</hi> Iſa. 1.11, to 18. And how peremptorily doth he beat men off from truſting in their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53132:121"/> as of no advantage without this practical godlineſs. <hi>Think not,</hi> ſaith the Baptiſt, <hi>to ſay within your ſelves, We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father,</hi> (this was a great Priviledge, for with him and his Seed was the Covenant made, and to them were Circumciſion, and the Paſs-over, the Seals of it given,) but what counſel doth he give them? truly, to mind practical godlineſs. <hi>Bring forth fruit meet for Repentance,</hi> i. e. for all the great priviledge in which you take ſo much pride, and upon which you lay ſo much ſtreſs; yet you can never flee from the wrath to come, unleſs you bring forth good fruit, <hi>fruit meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> ſuch fruit as will ſpeak your hearts to be changed, ſuch fruit as is ſuitable to a renewed nature. This, and this alone is practical godlineſs. The Coherence in that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. deſerves our Obſervation. And <hi>John</hi> ſaith unto the Phariſees, <hi>O Generation of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come: bring forth therefore fruit meet for repentance. And think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>to our Father: For I ſay unto you,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53132:122"/> that God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up Children to</hi> Abraham. Do not think that God is bound to, and muſt ſave you, becauſe ye are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, for God can of ſtones make Sons of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. And now alſo the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree, therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and caſt into the fire.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. IF Chriſt will condemn men at the Great Day for ſins of Omiſſion, for not relieving the Poor and Afflicted: It may inform us, That the condition of men meerly civil, and negatively religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, will be woful at that day. Why? Becauſe Chriſt will command them to depart from him into everlaſting fire. Ah how dreadful will it be to take an eternal Farewel of <hi>the Lord of Life, the God of all Grace, the Well of Salvation;</hi> and to enter into a ſtate of Death and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53132:122"/> Wrath, and that for ever. <hi>If the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly appear?</hi> 1 Pet. 3. By Sinner, I ſuppoſe, is meant the ſcandalous man, who liveth in Commiſſion. It's ſaid of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who had been guilty of notorious Enormities, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. <hi>For ſhe is a Sinner.</hi> And it's ſaid of the Publican, (whoſe whole Tribe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for Extortion and Bribery) <hi>That he was a Sinner. He is gone to be a Gueſt to one that is a Sinner.</hi> By Ungodly, as the very word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth, is meant one that liveth in Omiſſions, one that liveth without the Worſhip of God; <hi>i. e.</hi> without the Love and Fear, the Acknowledgment and Adoration of this God. Worſhip is that high Honour and Solemn Reſpect that the Creature owes to God: Not to give him this, is ungodlineſs. An ungodly man is one that doth not ſeek God, nor truſt God, nor obey God; that doth not own him in his Mercies as his Father and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, nor in his Judgments as a wiſe Maſter, that would by Chaſtiſements make him partaker of his Holineſs. <hi>Now if the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53132:123"/> the ſinner and ungodly appear?</hi> If there be a difficulty in the Salvation of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, there is a neceſſity of the damnation of the Sinner and ungodly. If the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous get ſo hardly to Heaven, the Sinner and Ungodly muſt ſurely be caſt into Hell. Where ſhall the Sinner and Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe that are guilty of theſe Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Commiſſions, appear? They muſt appear ſomewhere, but they can appear no where with comfort, or without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable horrour. Where ſhall they appear? before God? why, they hate his Being, deſpiſe his Dominions, ſlight his Love, diſobey his Laws, and indeed ſeek his Life; and can they appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? Can they look for a ſmile from his Face, who loath him perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? or can they ſtand before his Frowns and Fury? Do they know the weight of his Hand, the killing-darts of his Eye, and the Power of his Anger? No ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they cannot appear before him. <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared, and who may ſtand when thou art angry?</hi> Where ſhall they appear? Shall they appear before Chriſt the Judge of Quick and Dead? Before him, who ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53132:123"/> them earneſtly to come to him, and intreated them affectionately to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him, and life with him. Shall they appear before him? It's his Call which they have deſpiſed, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which they have violated. It's his Blood which they have trampled on, and his Spirit whom they have grieved. They are his Members whom the Sinners have oppreſſed and wronged, and his Children, and Spouſe, and Body, which the Ungodly have neglected, and not relieved. O how glad would they be if the Rocks would cruſh them to pieces, that they might be deliver'd from the wrath of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15. Their ſevere Sentence which may make every Ear to tingle, and Heart to tremble, that hears it, will proceed from his mouth; <hi>Then ſhall he ſay unto them on his left hand, Depart from me ye curſed into everlasting fire.</hi> But where ſhall theſe Sinners and Ungodly appear? Shall they appear before the Saints? Alas, with what face can they behold them, whoſe Perſons they have impriſon'd, whoſe Eſtates they have plundered, whoſe Profeſſion they have derided,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53132:124"/> whoſe Names they have abuſed, and whom they have often wiſhed out of the way, and thought the Troublers of the Family, and Town, and Country where they lived? If the Saints plead it muſt be againſt them, for they cannot but as Juſtices agree and concur with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Judge as righteous and juſt.</p>
               <p>But where ſhall they appear? Shall they appear before the Law? No, that condemneth them for the leaſt Omiſſion, for the ſmalleſt Commiſſion to Hell fire; they are the Prohibitions of the Law that the Sinner hath tranſgreſſed, and they are the Precepts of the Law that the Ungodly hath not obeyed; and therefore the Law curſeth them both to the uttermoſt. The Law enableth Sin to bind over the Tranſgreſſor of it to the Wrath and Curſe of God: Hence it's ſaid, <hi>The ſtrength of Sin is the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where ſhall they appear? Shall they appear before the Goſpel? No, their Omiſſions have moſt relation to the Goſpel. They have not believed the truth of it. They have not embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the goodneſs of it. They have not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53132:124"/> obeyed the Precepts of it. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the tenders of Pardon and Life made to them in the Goſpel, with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and fervency. They would not come to their Phyſitian to be healed of their mortal Diſeaſes. Though he came to them and offer'd his help freely, and aſſured them of effectual and ſpeedy recovery, if they would be directed by him; yet they rejected the Counſel of God againſt themſelves; therefore the Goſpel will condemn as ſurely and more ſorely than the Law.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.2, 3 Joh. 3.19.</note> 
                  <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfast, and every Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience received a juſt recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But where ſhall they appear? Shall they appear on Earth? Surely there will be no Earth then for them to appear in. That Earth which they ſported ſo much in, as <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the waters, and which they were fond of, and delighted in, will be burnt up with fire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fervent heat.</p>
               <p>But where ſhall they appear? Shall
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53132:125"/> they appear in Heaven? Can an unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied heart enter into the Holy of Holies? No. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. An impure Eye cannot behold ſuch an infinitely pure Object. When Angels (ſeated in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as their Habitation) once loſt their purity, they ſoon loſt that place. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven could not bear them; 'tis not as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, to take in all ſorts, Clean or Unclean. <hi>Into it can in no wiſe enter any thing that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> Rev. 21.27.

The rareſt Dainties and moſt curious Delicates are altogether unſavoury and unpleaſant to an aguiſh and diſtemper'd Palat.</p>
               <p>But where ſhall they appear? If they cannot appear before God their Maker, before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, before the Saints. Before whom ſhall they appear? If they cannot appear before the Law, before the Goſpel, before what ſhall they appear? It muſt be in Hell, before Devils and damned Spirits, with them to lodge and dwell for ever. Ah, the

A Day of <hi>Reſt</hi> from all their Labours, and Sorrows, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, bodily or ſpiritually, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. But it's the Day of Perdition of Ungodly men. They who live without God here, muſt live without him for ever; and this fartheſt, utmoſt, endleſs departure of the Creature from God, who is the only Life and Heaven of him, will be a Death and Hell with a witneſs. God will be God at that Day in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the worſt of men, though he be their laughing-ſtock and ſinning-ſtock at this day.</p>
               <p>Though theſe ungodly ones ſit aloft here in the Courts of men, and who but they; <hi>Yet the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly ſhall not ſtand in the Judgment,</hi> Pſal. 1.5. At the Great Day when they ſhall be judged, 1. They

Chriſt that ſometimes offer'd him that kindneſs, will now plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſo he muſt needs fall and be conquer'd by his Enemies.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Sixth Uſe of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note>6. IF Chriſt will ſay to them on the left hand, <hi>Depart from me. For I was Hungry and ye gave me no meat.</hi> Or if Chriſt will condemn men for ſins of Omiſſion at the Great Dy: It informs us, That Chriſt will be rational in his moſt ſevere proceedings, even to the Conviction of the Sinners own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I draw this from the Coherence of the verſes, Chriſt firſt pronounceth the Sentence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi> And then <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. he gives the reaſon, <hi>For I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat,</hi> &amp;c. which (though at firſt they ſeem to queſtion, yet) at laſt they are muzled and put to ſilence. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Condemnation and ſolemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of theſe ungodly Ones, as the chief buſineſſe of that Day. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he cometh with ten thouſand of his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53132:127"/> Saints to execute Judgment on all, and to convince all that are ungodly amongſt them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodlily committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches which ungodly Sinners have ſpoken againſt him,</hi> Jude, 14, 15. Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, by an <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> is put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conviction; yet one great work of that Great Day is to convince theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Ones, and the ſeverity of the Proceſs is againſt the Ungodly.</p>
               <p>This Conviction implyeth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. A reflection of Conſcience upon all their paſt and former ſins. Conſcience, as a Glaſs, ſhall repreſent to the Sinner all his luſts (which he hath loved above his Soul and Saviour) in all their ugly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and loathſome colours: <hi>The Books at that day will be opened,</hi> Rev. 20.12. <hi>i. e. The Book of Gods Remembrance, Mal.</hi> 3. <hi>and the Book of Conſcience.</hi> Sins are not gone as ſoon as done; God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords them in his Book of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and Conſcience will review them all in that Day of Vengeance. Though it could not be heard by the Sinner in this World, for the noiſe of his carnal delights, and cry of his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53132:128"/> worldly delights; yet when it ſets his ſins in order before his eyes in their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous frightful ſhapes, it will thunder in his Ears as <hi>Reuben</hi> to his Brethren, <hi>Did not I tell you of this, and ſay, Do not ſin, and thou wouldſt not hear; therefore all this Wrath, and Fury, and Flames, and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Chains, are come upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Conviction implyeth a ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Sinner, that he will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay either againſt God, or for himſelf. A man that is convinced, hath his mouth ſtop'd. When the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the World of ſin, the World hath not a word to ſay againſt the Sin and Guilt, which the Law chargeth on it. <hi>Every mouth is ſtoped, and all the World is guilty before God.</hi> How often is the poor Creature ſelf-convinced and ſelf-condemned here; but ſoon after the ſick qualms go off his ſtomach, and he is revived with the Cordials of ſinful ſhifts and excuſes, wherewith he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes himſelf, and preſumes he may alſo deceive God; but at the Great Day, as his Convictions will be more killing, ſo they will be more laſting. The man will be dumb and ſpeechleſs when Chriſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53132:128"/> ſhall ſay, Why didſt thou deny to relieve my Servants in their wants? Why didſt thou ſlight my Blood, neglect my Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, grieve my Spirit, and omit to obey my poſitive Laws? <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.3, 4, 5. The very Heathen who ſhall be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd in the dark dungeon of Hell, for impriſoning the Truth, and holding it in unrighteouſneſs, will not have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Breaſts of accuſing God for falſe Impriſonment. How certainly then and how fully will the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſtians, who lived under the Goſpel, juſtifie God, when he ſhall condemn them for not believing, and not repenting, upon the Meſſages he ſent to them of pardon and life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If Chriſt will condemn men at the Great Day for ſins of Omiſſion, It may inform us of the excellency of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion above all other Religions. The excellency of any Religion conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the purity of its Precepts, and ſtrictneſs of its Commands; now no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſo holy in its Commands, and ſo exact in its Laws as the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Moral Duties are advanced by it to their higheſt perfection, and moral
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53132:129"/> Vices are debaſed by it to their loweſt degradation. <hi>The Commandment of the Lord is pure,</hi> Pſal. 19. <hi>Thy Word is very pure.</hi> Chriſt will condemn men to Hell at the laſt Day for Omiſſions as well as Commiſſions, for neglect of known Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well as for the perpetration of groſs Enormities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider the Religion of the Heathen, we ſhall find that it is vaſtly inferior in purity to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (who lived without the Goſpel) it can ſcarce be ſaid there was any Religion at all, for their Gods were Stocks, and Stones, and Trees, and Fire, and Water, and Beaſts, and dead Men; nay, their Precepts were ſo far from purity, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and commanded impurity. As among the ancient <hi>Babylonians,</hi> in the Worſhip of <hi>Venus,</hi> the Women proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to all Strangers; nay, the very Gods of the Heathen did, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own fictitious Writers, patronize all their Impieties, even by their own Patterns. <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the chief forſooth of their Gods, who hath his Name from being an helping Father,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53132:129"/> commits Inceſt with his own Siſter <hi>Juno,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Minerva, Sodomy</hi> with <hi>Ganymedes,</hi> raviſheth <hi>Europa,</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth his Father <hi>Saturn</hi> out of his Kingdom. <hi>Venus</hi> was a Whore, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> a Thief, <hi>Bacchus</hi> a Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to leave theſe, and ſpeak to them that were more ſober in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and not ſo vain in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, who had <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the work of the Law written in their hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. and improved it to more purpoſe than others; yet theſe pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a little outward civility, without any inward or outward practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal godlineſs. Their chief devotion conſiſted in abſtaining from groſs ſins, which might expoſe them to the ſhame of men, and the doing ſome external acts of Piety, as ſacrificing and mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling over a few Prayers that were little ſignificant. O how vaſtly doth the Chriſtian Religion excel this! This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Heathen doth rather hide ſin then heal it. It doth not root the love of ſin out of the heart, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it in the life. But the Chriſtian Religion doth forbid ſin in the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53132:130"/> as well as in the Converſation, it doth <hi>abſcindere</hi> as well as <hi>abſcondere,</hi> cure ſin as well as cover it. In the beſt Heathen the fire of their Luſts was only raked up, and cover'd with aſhes, from the eyes of the World: But now in the Chriſtian it is quenched, at leaſt in part, and ſhall by degrees be wholly quenched. The Chriſtian Religion doth not only forbid all Sins, or outward Commiſſions, but alſo all Luſts and inward Inclinations. <hi>I beſeech you brethren to abſtain as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and Strangers, from all fleſhly Luſts, that war against the Soul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. And a religions Chriſtian doth not only forbear groſs Commiſſions, but alſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor ſecret ſinful motions. <hi>I hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I love,</hi> Pſal. 119.</p>
               <p>Thoſe among the Heathen who were the wiſeſt, made nothing of neglecting to give God their love, and fear, and truſt, their higheſt Honour, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Eſteem, and exacteſt Obedience, which are the chief of Religion. They allowed Revenge, in caſe of ſuffering Injury; and ſome of their greateſt Law-givers ordained Theft to be unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53132:130"/> if it could be done cleanly and cleaverly, ſo as not to be found out. They put away their Wives upon any ſmall diſtaſt, and took others during their pleaſure only. Their whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath not one Prohibition againſt inward Corruptions, nor one Precept for inward heart Duties; and therefore muſt of neceſſity come ſhort of the Chriſtian Religion for Purity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we conſider the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion, what a bundle of fooleries is <hi>Mahomets</hi> Alcoran, and what a dunghil of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Religion of his Followers. They allow a man as many Wives as he can maintain, and encourage men to murder, with a promiſe of a (Poetical, carnal) Paradiſe to all that ſhall die in the Wars againſt the Chriſtians. They obey the Luſts of their Tyrant in all things, even to the murder of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns neareſt Relations, or chiefeſt Miniſters of State, againſt the very light and law of Nature. They do not ſo much as profeſs to mind thoſe heart Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions and Precepts, without which all external Holineſs is but as a rotten Carkaſs, noiſome and unſavoury to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53132:131"/> Gods Noſtrils, and without any loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or life in his Eyes. Nay, the Popiſh Religion, ſo far as it differs from the true Chriſtian Religion, is impure. They have ſins that are Venial, allow publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Uncleanneſs. The Pope hath a Revenue out of the Stews; they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with <hi>Sodomy,</hi> inceſt, any Sin for money: They place all their Holineſs in ſome external Mortifications, which God never required at their hands. But what doth the Chriſtian Religion do? It reacheth the Heart, and teacheth the Soul: <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, Pſal.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It directs the whole Man, and gives Laws to all the powers of the Soul, and parts of the Body. It directs us about our Bodies and outward Converſation: It commands <hi>to preſent our Bodies a living Sacrifice to God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. <hi>and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Bodies as Inſtruments of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto Holineſs.</hi> It binds the Eyes, Ears, Tongue, Hands, Feet, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to their good behaviour: It allows not any part to be abuſed to prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.30, 31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53132:131"/> 16, 17. It directs us about our Souls: <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul, Pſal.</hi> 19.7. It changeth the nature of the Soul, and opens the eye of it, <hi>and turns it from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God,</hi> Act. 26.18. It directeth the mind to learn the Knowledge of God, as the richeſt Treaſure, and choiceſt Portion, and only Happineſs of the Creature; 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>And thou</hi> Solomon, <hi>my Son, know the God of thy Fathers.</hi> It directs the Will to chooſe this God for its ſuitable, and ſatisfying, and everlaſting felicity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. It limits the Affections as to their Objects, and their motion towards thoſe Objects. It forbids inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after, or delight in ſublumary Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and commands moderation in our love to all created Comforts. <hi>Let your moderation be known to all men. The time is ſhort, let them that have Wives, be as though they had none,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. It enjoyns our love in the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to be placed on the worthieſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and all thy Soul, and all thy Strength, Matth.</hi> 22.37. And
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53132:132"/> ſo our fear; <hi>Fear him that can caſt Body and Soul into Hell, I ſay unto you fear him.</hi> It keeps all the unruly paſſions within their proper banks and bounds, and preſerves the ſuperior and inferior facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their proper places. Now what Religion either of <hi>Moraliſts</hi> or <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> doth do?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it directs about the whole man, ſo it directs as to every part and paſſage of this mans Converſation. We need never be at a loſs for a Rule, or at a ſtand what to do, if we will but uſe diligence to know and underſtand the revealed Will of God. The Chriſtian Religion directs us in our Callings, whether Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Miniſters, Tradeſmen, Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. It directs us in our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Huſbands, Wives, Parents, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Maſters, Servants, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. It directs us in all Conditions how to demean our ſelves, in Proſperity to be joyful, in Adverſity to conſider how God hath ſet the one againſt the other. In Afflictions to be patient and prayerful, and more ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of a right improvement of them, than of deliverance out of them. Under
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53132:132"/> Mercies it directs us to be thankful to God, the more chearful in his Service, and faithful in the uſe of our Talents, for the honour of our Maſter. It di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us in all our Thoughts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. Words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.2. Works, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23, 24, 26. It directs us in all our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Actions, as Eating, Drinking, Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. In our civil Converſes, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. In our religious Duties, how to pray, <hi>James</hi> 5. <hi>James</hi> 1. How to hear, how to receive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its purity above and beyond all other Religions, appears in this, That it forbids Evil, all Evil, nothing but Evil; it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Good, whatſoever is Good, and nothing but Good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.14 The Laws of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> had ſomewhat of good in them, but not all prohibited, ſomewhat that was evil, but not all that was evil: But the Chriſtian Religion is of a larger extent both in its Precepts and Prohibitions. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but thy Commandments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad, Pſal.</hi> 119.96. A man with the eye of his Body may behold an end of many worldly Perfections, of many
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53132:133"/> fair Eſtates, great Beauties, large Parts, hopeful Families; but a man with the eye of his Soul (for by Faith) may ſee an end of all earthly Perfections. He may ſee the World in a flame, and all its Pomp, and Pride, and Glory, and Gallantry, and Crowns, and Scepters, and Riches, and Treaſures, turn'd into aſhes; he may ſee <hi>the Heavens paſſing away like a ſcroll, and the Elements melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with fervent heat, and the Earth with the things thereon conſumed;</hi> and all its Perſections which men doted ſo much on vaniſhed into ſmoke and nothing. It's eaſie to ſee to the end of all terrene Perfections, but its difficult, yea impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſee to the end of Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: <hi>But thy Commandments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad.</hi> Of a vaſt Latitude, beyond our apprehenſion. They are ſo deep, that none can fadom them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. So high, that they are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.48. So long, that they endure for ever, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. And ſo broad, that none can meaſure them. They are not only broad, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad. <hi>Higher than Heaven, longer than the Earth, broader than the Sea.</hi> The
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53132:133"/> Commands of God reach the inward parts, the moſt ſecret motions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired receſſes of the Soul: They reach all the privy thoughts. <hi>They pierce even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow, and diſcern the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4.12. They reach to all our Actions, to thoſe that ſeem ſmalleſt and of leſs concernment, as well as to thoſe that are greater, and of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
               <p>They reach to the manner, nay circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Actions. The Divine Law takes notice of all the circumſtances of ſins, as aggravations of ſin. As, 1. From the <hi>time</hi> of Gods patience towards the Sinner; <hi>Theſe three years I came ſeeking fruit,</hi> Luke 13. 2. The <hi>place</hi> where the ſin was committed; <hi>The Sons of</hi> Eli <hi>lay with the Women that aſſembled at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.22. 3. From the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of committing the Sin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3, 4. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the day of your Faſt, ye find plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and exact all your labour,</hi> &amp;c. 4. From the Condition of the perſon that ſins; <hi>He that eats bread with me, lifts up his
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53132:134"/> heels againſt mee,</hi> Joh. 13.18. A fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friend proves a treacherous Enemy. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Art thou a Maſter in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> 5. From the means the perſon enjoys; <hi>You only have I known, therefore you will I puniſh for your Iniquities,</hi> Amos 4. Rom. 2.7. 6. From the manner of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sin; <hi>So they ſpread</hi> Abſalom <hi>a Tent on the top of the houſe, and</hi> Abſalom <hi>went in to his Fathers Concubins in the ſight of all</hi> Iſrael, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.22. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency in ſin doth highly increaſe it. Were they aſhamed when they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all theſe Abominations? No, they were not aſhamed. But how far are other Religions from obſerving, much more from condemning men for ſuch ſinful circumſtances?</p>

If ſuch a laborious perſon found cauſe of bewailing his Omiſſions, ſurely
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53132:135"/> much more cauſe have Loyterers as we are.</p>
               <p>Omiſſions are fruits of Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as well as Commiſſions: It's from that dead ſtock that we are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in bringing forth good fruit. <hi>Paul</hi> layeth his Omiſſions at this door, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17, <hi>to</hi> 23. <hi>In my fleſh is no good.

Now whatſoever is the Child of ſuch a monſtrous Parent is loathſome, and calls on us for ſorrow and ſelf-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency. Holy <hi>Job</hi> did but ſuſpect his Children to be guilty of Omiſſions, of not ſanctifying the Name of God in their Hearts, according to their Duties, at their Feaſts and Meetings; <hi>And he riſeth early and offereth Sacrifice, according to the number of them all,</hi> Job 1.4, 5.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53132:135"/> their behalf, by way of humiliation, acknowledging their Iniquity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching his Mercy: What cauſe have we on the behalf of our own Souls, who know that we often offend God by Omiſſions, and know not how often we offend him by them? God may ſay to thee and me, <hi>Reader, Is not thy Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs great, and Iniquities infinite,</hi> as he to <hi>Job, Job</hi> 20.5.

And <hi>Eliphaz</hi> calls his Wickedneſs <hi>great,</hi> becauſe, as I have ſhew'd in the firſt Information, they are in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects greater, more hainous than ſins of Omiſſion; and his <hi>Iniquities infinite,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſins of Omiſſion are more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than ſins of Commiſſion. Corrupt Nature can much better forbear what it hath an inclination and propenſity to, than do that which it hath a diſlike of, and an enmity againſt.</p>
               <p>For their nature I have proved, that they are very ponderous, that they are
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53132:136"/> breaches of a poſitive Law, grieve the Holy Ghoſt, provoke God, defile the Conſcience; yea, and deſtroy the Soul for ever, (how light ſoever ſome make of them,) and for their number they are <hi>infinite,</hi> beyond all account or reckonings. If they were ſmall ſins, their number would compenſate their lightneſs; grains of ſand are little, but an heap of them together is weighty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.3. <hi>The ſand is weighty. In many things we offend all,</hi> James 3.2. Now how ſhould the nature and number of theſe ſins humble us every day before the the Lord? What hour is there when we are awake, wherein we may not do more good than we do? When did we in viſiting a Friend, or conferring with a Neighbour, advantage their Souls as we might and ought? Can we ſay that we have been as diligent in our Callings, as watchful and exemplary in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, as thankful for our Mercies, as fruitful under the Ordinances of God, and as faithful in the improvement of our Talents as we are commanded to be? Do we every day pray and read Scripture in our Cloſets and Families
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53132:136"/> with that holy reverence, humility, faith, ſeriouſneſs and integrity which God requireth? Do not worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns now and then contend with, and juſtle out the Worſhip of the Great God, at leaſt cauſe us to ſlip our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and adjourn the Scriptures reading till a more convenient ſeaſon? Are we every week-day laborious in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings out of Conſcience to Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and not out of a principle of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs? Do we ſpend the greateſt part of the day therein, without diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by vain Companions, or needleſs Recreations? Are our Affections in Heaven, and our Hearts above, while our Actions are earthly, and our Hands are buſie here below. And do we deal in all things with others, as we would in the Judgment of ſound reaſon that others ſhould deal with us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.12. Is our daily carriage towards our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſober, pious, affectionate, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary, and in all things as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt? O how many are our Omiſſions, and what millions of them are we guilty of, and therefore they call aloud upon us to mourn for them?
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53132:137"/> Others are in Hell, and muſt weep for ever for them; where their Sighs and Sobs, and Prayers and Tears, will no way advantage them. Bleſſed be God it is not ſo with us; though their Tears will prove their Hell, our Tears, through the blood of Chriſt, may prove our Heaven. <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in the day of his ſolemn Humiliation with the <hi>Jews,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth and bewaileth their Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, their not hearkening to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and their not minding the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he wrought for them, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.16, 17. So <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he faſted and pray'd, and confeſſed his ſins, and the ſins of his people, bewails their Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.6. <hi>We have not hearkened unto thy Servants the Prophets which ſpake in thy Name, to our Kings, and Princes, and Fathers, and to all the people of the Land,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>We have not obeyed the Voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the Laws which he ſet before us, by his Servants the Prophets,</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>All this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God.</hi> What then? why, he judgeth himſelf and his people for theſe ſins, and juſtifieth God in all
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53132:137"/> his ſeverity. <hi>O Lord, Righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to thee, but to us confuſion of face, as at this day, to the men of</hi> Juda <hi>and Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. So again, <hi>O Lord, to us belongeth confuſion of face: to our Kings, to our Princes, to our Fathers, becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee,</hi> verſ. 8. Omiſſions muſt be lamented in this or the other World; we muſt all be aſhamed of them here or hereafter; and is it not much better to bewail them here, than to bewail them in Hell; to judge and condemn our ſelves for them, than to be judged and condemned by God for them at the Great Day. Ah, at what a cheap rate may a Chriſtian, by Repentance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that blow that will ſeparate him and all his happineſs, and bring him to that Repentance which will ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, but all to no purpoſe! Oh it's good to be wiſe on this ſide another World.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. THis Doctrine may be uſeful in the ſecond place by way of Examination or Trial. If Chriſt will condemn men at the Great Day for ſins of Omiſſion, then it concerns us to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves, whether or no we are of the number of them that ſhall be condemned for them at that day. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> it will not be amiſs for thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire out of the crowd of the World into thy Chamber, and there to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with thine own heart concerning thy preſent Condition, and how thou art like to fare for the future; nay, it is of infinite weight and concernment, and may be as much worth as thy Soul and eternal Salvation. How many prove Bankrupts, and are quite undone for this World, for want of a timely caſting up their accounts. If they had caſt up their accounts before, and perceived how far they had ran behind-hand, they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53132:138"/> might have retrenched their Expences, and adviſed and conſulted ſome way to have prevented their utter deſtruction; but they neglected to caſt up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, till their accounts caſt them up, and it was too late to think of recalling what was paſt, or remedying what was amiſs. Thus many that are Profeſſors, or Chriſtians in title, deal with their own Souls, and defer the trial of their eſtates till it be too late to amend any thing amiſs. If they would now in their health and ſtrength ſearch and try their hearts and ways, if they found things ill, they would have advantages and opportunities through the help of Chriſt to make them better: <hi>They might ſeek the Lord while he would be found, and call upon him while he is near.</hi> They might ſue and ſeek to Chriſt for Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve, that they might ſee the things of their Peace; for Raiment to hide their Nakedneſs, that it might not appear to their everlaſting ſhame; and for Gold to enrich them for ever, to make them more worth than both Worlds: If upon a faithful trial, they found things well, it would rejoyce their hearts, encourage
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53132:139"/> them in ways of holineſs, and confirm them againſt Satans Temptations to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. But men generally neglect their Examinations, till God comes to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them (as the Rulers command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Paul</hi> to be examined) with ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings and ſcorpions. They preſume all is well, hope the beſt, and would be ſorry any ſhould queſtion their eſtates, and thus perſiſt in their ſelf-deceits, till they come to appear before God, that the gate of Mercy be ſhut, and the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Scepter of Grace be wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, and their eſtates become as deſperate as the eſtates of the Devils.</p>
               <p>To urge this Uſe a little, <hi>Reader,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe two particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider of what weight it is, and how much depends upon this queſtion. Am I of the number of them that ſhall be condemned for ſins of Omiſſion or not? Or am I guilty of Omiſſions, ſo as to be baniſhed the preſence of Chriſt for them or not? I tell thee, thy eternal Joy or Sorrow, Happineſs or Miſery, Pleaſure or Pain depends on it. Do but read and conſider, and then ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not of infinite weight; <hi>Come
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53132:139"/> ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you before the foundation of the World. For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; thirſty, and ye gave me drink,</hi> &amp;c. On the other ſide, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels: For I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ye gave me no meat; thirſty, and ye gave me no drink,</hi> &amp;c. Friend, are not theſe weighty things that depend on the performance or neglect of theſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts? <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father.</hi> Is not a coming (cloſe, near, intimate, familiar, into his very boſom and deareſt embraces,) to Chriſt a weighty thing? To come to Chriſt here is ſo weighty, that he came to men into this World to call them to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. But to come to Chriſt there in all his Robes, and Riches, and Royalty, in all his Beauty, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Magnificence, will queſtionleſs be of more concern to the Soul. On the contrary, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Is there not weight, <hi>Reader,</hi> in theſe words? Doſt thou know what it is to bid Chriſt farewel, farewel for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53132:140"/> ever, to take an eternal leave of all good? Canſt thou bear the extremity of our Culinary fires for a day? Canſt thou dwell in everlaſting burnings, or abide unquenchable flames? Thou ſeeſt all this depends upon thy performing or neglect of the Divine poſitive Precepts. Doth it not concern thee in a matter of ſuch weight to be faithful in the trial of thy ſelf? Friend, are Life and Death? are eternal Life and eternal Death indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, or things of ſmall moment? Are an eternal enjoyment of God, or an endleſs ſeparation from God mean or trivial things? Oh how infinitely do they exceed and over-ballance thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding! How ſhort muſt thou of neceſſity come of conceiving of theſe things according to their weight? Alas, Friend, what pitiful toys and trifles are Houſes, and Lands, and Friends, and Relations, and Honors, and Preferments, I, and Liberty, and this temporal Life, to an eternal happy Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider all are guilty of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even the Good as well as the Bad, and therefore the more faithfulneſs, and prudence, and caution is requiſite, leſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53132:140"/> we miſtake. If Saints and Sinners are both guilty of Omiſſions, how ſhall I know whether my Omiſſions are ſuch as will conſiſt with Salvation, unleſs I try and examine my ſelf. The good man being guilty of Omiſſions, may fear the dreadful Sentence of, <hi>Go ye curſed,</hi> &amp;c. And the wicked man knowing that the beſt are guilty of many Omiſſions, as well as he may preſume upon the joyful Sentence, <hi>Come thou bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. How ſhall each be rectified in his miſtake, and ſatisfied in the truth, but by an impartial and through examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf? God hath given us a Teſt, which is the word of Truth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. whereby we may try our ſelves, and prevent all miſtakes. Where there is a poſſibility of a miſtake in a buſineſs of ſuch infinite weight, there is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for a ſerious trial; but where there is ſo great a probability of miſtaking, as a thing that is ſo eaſie and ordinary (becauſe all men are guilty too much of Omiſſions) there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a faithful and impartial trial. There is that maketh himſelf rich, (in Temporals he is worth thouſands, in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53132:141"/> Spirituals he is rich towards God, and worth millions,) yet hath nothing, (<hi>Orig.</hi> yet <hi>nothing,</hi> in him or to him he is nothing, he hath nothing for all his brags,) there is that makes himſelf poor, (ſpeaks himſelf poor, would have others think him poor,) yet hath great riches, (<hi>Hebr.</hi> yet much ſubſtance; the man hath a great Eſtate, but is willing to conceal it. Merchants, who are worth thouſands, do not publiſh or boaſt of their Wares or Wealth about the City; thoſe poor Creatures do it, who carry all their worth on their Heads, or in their Arms.) <hi>Junius</hi> reads the words well, <hi>Est qui divitem ſe jactat quum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſint omnia, item qui pauperem ſe fingit cui ſubstantia ampla.</hi> There is that boaſts himſelf rich, to whom all things are wanting; and that feigns himſelf poor, yet hath large ſubſtance. There is that boaſts and brags himſelf rich in the fear and favour of God, and will tell you of his communion and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with the Divine Majeſty, of his love to, and delight in the Ways, and People, and Ordinances of God; when all theſe things are wanting to him, he
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53132:141"/> hath nothing at all in reality of any of them. There is that fains himſelf poor, that diſſembles (as it were) his eſtate, that is a Beggar (as ſome read the word <hi>Poor</hi> here) in his own account, and would have all others judge him ſo too; he is ſo covetous after more, that he over-looks what he hath; and ſo greedy of further attainments, that he takes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle notice of his preſent ſpiritual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If you will believe him, he is a meer Beggar, hath not one bit of bread to eat, and if his Father <hi>(in whoſe houſe there is bread enough and to ſpare)</hi> do not pity and relieve his prodigal Child, he ſhall periſh for hunger; yet this man hath much ſubſtance, is a man of worth and wealth indeed. He is like a branch mightily laden with fruit, and an ear fully laden with corn, which the heavier they are laden, the more they bow down to the ground. A meer titular Chriſtian, like an empty Veſſel, may make a great ſound, but the full Veſſel, that contains the precious Liquor, is ſilent.</p>
               <p>I come now to the marks whereby men may know their eſtates. And for that end I ſhall lay down ſeveral Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:53132:142"/>1. <hi>Propoſition.</hi> Thoſe that live in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions as well as Omiſſions, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be condemned at the Great Day. Theſe bid open defiance to the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Precepts, and Penalty of the Law, and dare the Law to do its worſt. Either theſe muſt be condemned, or all ſhall be ſaved. But God is of an holier Nature than to dwell with ſuch Sinners. They may read their doom written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own hand, and like the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians, That cannot be alter'd;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>To be carnally minded is death,</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Propoſition.</hi> They who are guilty of total external Omiſſions, are in a damnable Condition. This is written in broad Letters, that he who runs may read it. They who pray not are under wrath, and the effuſions of wrath, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> They who neglect to pay their external Allegiance to the true God, and deny him his outward Homage and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, ſhall be denied and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by Chriſt, before his Father, and before his holy Angels. The Holy God doth all along ſpeak of theſe as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53132:142"/> Heathens, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.6. and Sinners with a witneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1, 2, 3. and threatneth that Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire, to render Vengeance on them, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9, 10. Thoſe who are guilty of theſe total Omiſſions, in regard of the matter of the Duties commanded them, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly in the higheſt degree, (for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs ſtrictly and properly ſpeaks the neglect of our Duties to God, and ſins againſt the firſt Table, as unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs the neglect of our Duties to our Neighbour, and our Tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Second Table,) and ſo none in the whole Scripture more obnoxious to wrath and ruine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.12. Theſe are the Ungodly who proſper in the World, but mark how ſoon they periſh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Thou casteſt them down to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and utterly conſumeſt them with terrours;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Propoſition.</hi> Thoſe who perform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Duties, and wholly neglect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or pleaſe themſelves in total in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Omiſſions, cannot be in a ſtate of Salvation. God will not be put off with the Body, without the Soul of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53132:143"/> Religion. Indeed, external Duties are but the Garments or Cloaths of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wherein it appears, and whereby it is known to the World; the life and power of it conſiſts in internal Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, or thoſe that are the motions and actions of the Underſtanding, and Will, and Affections, as in the Knowledg of God, his Being and Excellency, and the kindneſs he hath for, and the love he hath to Mankind in Jeſus Chriſt; as alſo in the chooſing him for our richeſt Treaſure, and ſupream Lord and Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in loving him with all the heart, and Soul, and ſtrength, and deſiring his love above all the World, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Favour, as the Souls felicity, and ſeeking to pleaſe him, rather than to command the Creation. A man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe is but the Picture of a Saint; he hath ſomewhat of the reſemblance, but nothing of the reality of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: He hath a form, but nothing of the power of godlineſs, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <hi>to</hi> 7.) and therefore is in a ſtate of perdition. The neglect of believing, repenting, loving the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are all inward Omiſſions, (for theſe are
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53132:143"/> acts proper and peculiar to the Soul) and condemned in Scripture with the moſt dreadful damnation, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Luke</hi> 13.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. If a man pray, and pray wholly without Faith, and without fervency, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. this is no way acceptable to God. All ſuch prayers are howlings and bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and of no ſweet ſound in Gods Ears, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man doth either by way of hearing, or ſinging, or praying, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, if there be not that dread of God, and love to his Name, and Faith in Chriſt, which are the eſſentials of theſe Duties, all is as nothing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Propoſition.</hi> Thoſe who allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in partial Omiſſions, whether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or internal, are in no good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. By partial Omiſſions, I mean at ſometimes, as for prayer; a man, it may be, prays in his Cloſet or Family uſually, but if any worldly buſineſs intervene and calls for his company, he will as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attend on that, and wholly omit his Cloſet and Family-Duties for that Morning or Evening. Or for a man to pray, as ſome do only at the Evening,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53132:144"/> and not in the Morning; as if God were the God of the Night, and not of the Day; or as ſome others, who will pray only upon the Lords-Day, as if God had a right to them then, but not all the week after. Or when men perform ſome religious Duties, and not others, will pray, but not read Scripture daily; or pray, and read the Word, but not take notice of thoſe under their Roofs, to inſtruct, and admoniſh, and ſupport them, as occaſion is. Or ſome will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Duties which immediately concern God, but will not be charitable to the Poor, at leaſt not in ſuch a degree and meaſure as their Eſtates will bear, and as God expects. Theſe, and ſuch like, I underſtand by partial and external Omiſſions. What is meant by internal partial Omiſſion is next to be conſider'd. Partial internal Omiſſions, are, when men oftentimes, though not conſtantly, are negligent in the manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Duties; and though they be formal, and ſuperficial, and lazy, and ſlothful in the Worſhip of God; yet they take little or no notice thereof. Indeed, ſometimes they find ſome heat
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53132:144"/> and warmth, and this pleaſeth them, but at other times they are cold and liveleſs in their Duties, and this doth not much diſpleaſe them. They can commonly pray as if they pray'd not, and read as if they read not, and wait on God without any ſuitable and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable affections towards him, and not be diſturbed at it. Theſe ſudden heats at one time, and colds at another time, ſpeak (the Body out of order, and) the Soul not healthy. The next thing to be explain'd, is, what is meant by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing themſelves in partial Omiſſions, and indeed the ſtreſs of the Propoſition depends on that. To allow themſelves in theſe partial Omiſſions notes theſe two things: To know theſe partial Omiſſions to be ſins, and yet to continue in them without any great diſturbance or trouble of Spirit. They muſt know that they are ſins, otherwiſe continuance in them will not argue a total want of Grace, or the predominant power of ſenſuality in the Soul. I doubt not, but in many dark places of this Nation, there may be thoſe who live in a total Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome Duties, as praying with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53132:145"/> their Families, and a ſtrict ſanctification of the Sabbath; or who yet fear God in truth, and make great Conſcience of their Converſations. Theſe men neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect prayer, and devoting the Sabbath wholly to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe they do not know them to be their Duties. And where a man deſires and endeavours to know his Maſters Will, and lives up to that Light God hath given him, he may upon a general repentance expect par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don through the blood of Chriſt for ſins of Ignorance. But thoſe who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the clear and plain, and full diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Goſpel, muſt know that theſe Omiſſions are ſins. Their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are not ſo ignorant, or unfaithful, as to leave them in the dark about ſuch neceſſary Duties. <hi>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> James 4. ult. The ſecond thing in this allowance, is, to continue in theſe Omiſſions, though we know them to be Sins, and to be little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing troubled for them. And, I ſay, thoſe who do ſo, are in no good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſhall be condemned at the Great Day. And my reaſons are partly
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53132:145"/> becauſe its proper to a wicked man to continue in ſins. A ſheep may fall into the Ditch and defile himſelf, but he haſtens out of it as ſoon as he can; but the Swine chooſeth a dirty place, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth all the day long in the mud and mire. A Saint may fall into ſin, but he haſteneth to recover himſelf by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. A Sinner lives in it day and night, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.17. It's their Food in the day, and their refreſhment in the night: <hi>Their ſleep departeth from them, unleſs they cauſe ſome to fall.</hi> Hence we read, That ſin is their Way, or Work, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. Partly becauſe allowance of any ſin is inconſiſtent with Grace. Sin and Grace are contrary each to other; and therefore though they may be, and are in the ſame Subject, yet they are not, they cannot be there together, but as Enemies ſeeking the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction one of another. <hi>The Fleſh luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt Fleſh; for theſe are contrary the one to the other.</hi> Fire and Water are not more contrary than Vice and Grace, ſo that he who ſuffers Vice without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, declares plainly that he hath no
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53132:146"/> Grace, for theſe Enemies never meet but they fight. Therefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> examine thy ſelf, thou haſt laid down the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Evil, but haſt thou taken up every known Duty? Thy Reaſon will tell thee he is a bad Huſband who drains his ground, and then neither ſoweth nor planteth it. It's all one as if it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under water; as good be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drain'd, as unimproved when drain'd.</p>

                  <hi>Ex.</hi> IF Chriſt will condemn men at the Great Day for ſins of Omiſſion: It may exhort us to mind the doing of Good, as well as the forbearing of Evil, to be as watchful againſt ſins of Omiſſion as well as againſt ſins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and make Conſcience of Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative as well as Negative Commands. Do not think it ſufficient to forbear what is Evil, unleſs alſo thou doſt what is Good. It's good not to be evil in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53132:146"/> doing what the Law forbids, but it's evil alſo not to be good in doing what the Law enjoyns. The Miniſter is not a good Miniſter, becauſe he doth not ſeduce, or miſlead, or deceive his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by falſe Doctrine, or ſcandalous living, if he do not teach them the right ways of the Lord, and be not inſtant with them in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, to Know, and Adore, and Honour their Maker and Redeemer. A good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard muſt look to good Paſtures for his Sheep, as well as defend them from Lions and Wolves. <hi>Paul</hi> proves his Integrity by this, <hi>That he kept nothing back that was profitable for his people, but taught them publickly, and from houſe to houſe, and that he declared unto them the whole Counſel of God,</hi> Act. 20.21, 22, 27. The Magiſtrate is not a good Magiſtrate, who can only ſay that he never oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or perſecuted the Innocent. He muſt be able to ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them in their Neceſſities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed them in their Grievances: <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Poor that cryed, and the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and him that had none to help. I was eyes to the Blind, and feet to the Lame.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53132:147"/> I brake the jaws of the Wicked, and pluckt the ſpoil out of his Teeth,</hi> Job 29.12, 15, 17. The Chriſtian is not a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that can only tell us that he is an harmleſs man, he doth no miſchief, he wrongs none in thought, word, or deed. The barren Tree brings forth no bad fruit, yet it's cut down for the fire. He is an evil man that neglects what is good, as well as he that follows what is evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.31.</note>Therefore, <hi>Reader, Ceaſe to do evil,</hi> (but let not that ſuffice) <hi>learn to do well,</hi> Iſa. 1. Remember to watch againſt what is evil; <hi>But alſo to do good, and to diſtribute, forget not: for with ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice God is well pleaſed,</hi> Heb. 13.16. To do good, and to pray in thy Cloſet and Family, and to read the Scriptures, and to inſtruct thy Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to ſanctifie the Lords-Day, and to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their Afflictions;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> 
                  <hi>forget not, for with ſuch Sacrifice God is well pleaſed. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the fooliſh,</hi> (this is well, but not enough, and) <hi>walk in the way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law of God muſt be kept ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53132:147"/> as the very apple of our eyes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.2. The ſmalleſt duſt will offend the eye, and the ſmalleſt Omiſſion will offend the Law. If thy Conſcience be diſpenſatory, it is unholy. Friend, thou haſt largely heard how far ſhort a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Religion will bring thee of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and canſt thou content thy ſelf a moment therewith? Nay, thou haſt heard that for all that thou ſhalt be ſent to Hell, and wilt thou reſt one day or night therein? O Friend, be wiſe in time, and mind poſitive godlineſs, whilſt thou haſt opportunity.</p>
               <p>In theſe days of the Goſpel, God is quick and ſpeedy, ſharp and ſevere with men that are barren and unfruitful. <hi>Behold now,</hi> ſaith the Baptiſt, <hi>the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree.</hi> Behold, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, now at this time, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is coming, whoſe way I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring; <hi>Now the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree,</hi> Matth. 3.10. He is now lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide his Basket, and taking up the Ax; yea, he lays his Ax at the root of the Tree, as one taking aim where to ſtrike, and how to fell the Tree with the greateſt advantage; therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53132:148"/> thee to be fruitful. Again, the Apoſtle tells us, That former times of groſs darkneſs were over-lookt by God, but now ſaith he, Now his Son is come into the World, and he reveals his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and our Duty ſo fully and clearly; <hi>Now he commands men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> Act. 17.29, 30. Now he exhorts fruits meet for Repentance, or he will not wink at your Diſobedience, but judge you to Hell flames. And believe it, the Valley of Viſion will prove the heavieſt burden, and the higheſt means will caſt thy Soul into the loweſt miſery. Opportunities of doing good to our own and others Souls, are choice Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. They are Talents that muſt one day be reckoned for: Therefore ſaith the bleſſed Redeemer in the juſtification of <hi>Mary</hi> about the Oyntment; <hi>Me ye have not always;</hi> the poor ye have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and may do them good when ye will; <hi>but me ye have not always. Mary</hi> did well to improve the ſeaſon ſhe had in her hand, as knowing if once loſt, it was loſt for ever.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> upon this account adviſeth the <hi>Galathians, While ye have
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53132:148"/> time, do good to all,</hi> Gal. 6.10. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſads and dulls the heart, when one comes to die, ſaith a Divine now with God, than his neglect of ſuch opportunities which God's Providence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſſex herſe,</hi> p. 19.</note> or his own Place, have put into his hands of doing or receiving good. Nor is there a ſharper Corroſive than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon thoſe days and times that have paſſed over him, <hi>Male aliud nihil agentem.</hi> Ah how ſad and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will it be for thy time to be gone, when thy work is not done! when thy Sun is ſetting, and the ſhadows of the Evening are ſtretching themſelves upon thee, for Conſcience to give thee this ſalute, Thy day is paſſed, thy time is waſted, the buſineſs of life is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and now thine Errors can never, never be amended. Ah what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hour will a dying-hour be to thee, when Conſcience ſhall plead againſt thee with Whips, and Scorpions, and Flames, and not the deareſt Friend or Relation thou haſt be admitted to plead for thee, or be able to comfort thee! But if the day of death will be ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, how terrible will the Day of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53132:149"/> Judgment be? Then it is that the Saint ſhall reap the benefit of all the good he hath done, and the Sinner ſhall reap the miſchief of all the good he hath omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or left undone. Then the idle Servant that did not trade with his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, will be found an evil Servant, and as ſuch condemned to the <hi>Worm that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dieth, and the Fire that never goeth out,</hi> Mat. 25. Then the unfruitful Factor will be found an unfaithful Factor, and as ſuch diſown'd and condemned by his Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> believe it, though thou mayſt live by a Negative Religion, yet thou canſt not die by it, much leſs ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt with it. It's true, even ſuch a Religion is of high price with men, but if alone it's abomination in the ſight of God. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> let me reaſon the caſe with thee; In other things all are for fruitfulneſs in what is good: The Huſbandman would have his ground fruitful in good Corn, as well as empty of weeds. He would have his Cattel labour, and do him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and thinks it not enough that they are in the ſtable or fields and do him no hurt. The Maſter would have his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53132:149"/> induſtrious in his Shop or Field, or ſome way or other about his buſineſs, and is not pleaſed to ſee him ſit ſtill all day, and forbear to purloin his Goods, or fight with his fellow Servants. The Father who ſends his Child to School, would have him learn the Languages, and profit daily therein, and without this will not be ſatisfied to hear that his Child ſits ſtill all day at School, learns no Oaths or Blaſphemies, calls no Names, abuſes none of his Companions. And, <hi>Reader,</hi> why ſhould God be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thy harmleſneſs, when thou art barren and unprofitable? Hath not God as much right to thee as thou haſt to thy Ground or Cattel? and art not thou as much bound to God as thy Servant or Child is bound to thee? and why then ſhouldſt thou think to put God off with that in thy ſelf, which thou wilt not be put off with in thy ground, or Cattel, or Servant, or Child? Beſides, I muſt tell thee thou art not harmleſs, if thou doſt no good, though thou liveſt not in the Commiſſion of groſs Evils. The Tree in the Garden that brings not forth good fruit is hurtful, though it bring not
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53132:150"/> forth evil fruit, partly becauſe it cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the ground, and takes up room to no purpoſe; partly becauſe it draws the moiſture of the earth to it, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the thriving of thoſe Trees that are near it, who, but for them, would be more fruitful. So if thou neglecteſt what is good, though thou doſt no open ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous evil, thou art miſchievous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the place where thou liveſt. Thou takeſt up the room of a Member that might be ſerviceable to God and his Country. If thou wert gone, there might be one in thy Houſe, Place, Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, kept and maintain'd by the Great Houſe-keeper of the World, with the ſame Mercies with which thou liveſt, that ſhould adorn the Goſpel, glorifie the Name of God, and edifie the Souls of others; and doſt thou no harm then by hindring ſuch a one? Is not the Drone hurtful, which idleth all the day, and lives upon the Bees labour, and forceth them ſometimes to want, becauſe of her Theft? Is not the Wem in the Body hurtful, when it ſerves to no uſe; yet ſucks away the nouriſhment from other parts of the Body. Doth not that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53132:150"/> Factor wrong the Maſter who imploys him, if he let his ſtock lie ſtill, though he do not waſte it in Riotouſneſs, and Drunkenneſs, and Filthineſs, when the Maſter might have had one in his place who would have traded with it; and (probably) have improved it to his great advantage? Did ever any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant truſt a Servant with a ſtock to lie by him? Nay, is Nature it ſelf content with the removal of what is oppreſſive? doth it not long and breath after what is perfective? Is not the preſence of <hi>malum,</hi> what is evil, a burden? So the abſence of <hi>bonum,</hi> what is good, occaſion of complaint? There is ingrafted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us not only <hi>Bados,</hi> a depth of diſtaſt againſt feared Evils; but alſo <hi>Hiatus,</hi> large deſires after known Good. As Nature, much more doth Religion call men off what is bad, and provoke men to what is right, and juſt, and good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> let me come up a little cloſer to thee; What is it that I am adviſing thee to? Is it any thing that is evil? If it be, reject and renounce it. Is it not to be good, and to do good? I will tell thee what I would deſire of thee, and then
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53132:151"/> do thou judge whether I adviſe thee as a Friend, or whether my Counſel be worth hearkning to or no?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of external Omiſſions. If thou haſt been faulty herein, I would adviſe thee every day to mind Prayer, Scripture, watchfulneſs over thy Heart, Tongue, and Actions, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in thy Calling, faithfulneſs in thy Relations, and to do good to others as thou haſt opportunity. Hereby thou wilt acknowledge thy dependance on, and ſubſiſtance by the bleſſed God, to whom thou art bound by millions of Obligations: Hereby thou wilt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Protection of thy Perſon, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for thy Family, and Benediction on thy Calling, and all thine Undertakings. And is this ill Counſel, to direct thee to the way how to procure his Favour which can ſweeten the bittereſt Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and turn the moſt loathſome Priſon into a lovely Palace, and an Hell of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into an Heaven of Mercy? Friend, do I adviſe thee for thy hurt, when I adviſe thee daily to walk and converſe with the bleſſed and glorious God? Is not his Law worth obſerving, his Glory worth advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53132:151"/> and his Service worth minding, and his Love worth accepting, when he can make thee miſerable or happy with a word, in an inſtant; when thou and all thou haſt are in his hand every moment, to be diſpoſed of for Good or Evil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together at his Pleaſure, when he can with the breath of his Noſtrils, with the blaſt of his Lips, with a glance of his Eye, ſend thee to Hell, <hi>where the Worm never dieth, and the Fire never goeth out?</hi> Friend, conſider it, Is it not good advice to wiſh thee to ſue and ſeek to him, to pray to and pleaſe him, upon whom thine unchangeable Felicity or Miſery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, and who ſhall judge thee to thine everlaſting ſtate of Life or Death? Is it not good to have the King thy Friend? how many Pleaſures may he do thee? and how many Favours may he beſtow on thee? But how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it to have the King of Kings thy Friend? What Pleaſure is there which he cannot do thee? what Favour which he cannot beſtow on thee? He can give thee Earth, Heaven, Riches, Honours, Pleaſures, Life, Health, Food, Raiment, Friends, Relations, his Day, his Word,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53132:152"/> his Ordinances, his Love, his Image, his Peace, his Joy, his Spirit, his Son, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, every Good, any Good, all Good. O how bleſſed is he that hath this God! But, <hi>Reader,</hi> wouldſt thou have all theſe without ſo much as aſking for them? We ſay, they are poor Favours that are not worth aſking. Sure I am, theſe Mercies are of more value than thine Underſtanding can conceive; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt deſerve more Prayers, and Tears, and Groans for them than thou art capable of giving. Do not any day, upon any pretence, omit to offer up thy Morning and Evening Sacrifices. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, ſo often as thou neglecteſt Morning-Prayer, ſo often thou art all the day naked, deſtitute of thy ſpiritual Guard, and expoſed to all manner of Evils and Enemies, and doſt fore-ſpeak thy ſelf an evil Day; and ſo often as thou omitteſt Evening-Prayer, thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeſt upon ſleep, and reſt, and ſafety, without God's leave, and fore-ſpeakeſt thy ſelf an evil Night? What did <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> loſe by one Omiſſion. Jeſus appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt day of the week to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>but Thomas,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>was
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53132:152"/> not there,</hi> Joh. 20.24. But what is the iſſue of this Omiſſion? truly, by his neglecting this opportunity of confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Faith, he falls into a deſperate fit of Unbelief. When the Apoſtles told him, <hi>That they had ſeen the Lord,</hi> He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwers, <hi>Except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the Nails, and put my finger into the print of the Nails, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not believe,</hi> Joh. 20.24, 25. Ah what had become of <hi>Thomas,</hi> if infinite Majeſty had not ſtooped to recover him!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of internal Omiſſions. In the next place I adviſe thee to look ſeriouſly to the manner of thy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, to be ſure that thou worſhip God with thy Heart and Affections. This is the chief, and ſubſtance, and heart of thy Performances, according to which they ſhall be accepted or not. In all thy Addreſſes draw nigh to God with an humble Faith and Confidence, as to a Father, ready, able, and willing to ſupply all thy wants, and anſwer all thy Doubts, and to grant all thy Prayers and Deſires; as alſo with a chearful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and awfulneſs, as to a God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53132:153"/> in his Being, and in all his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, between whom and thee a poor worm there is an infinite diſtance. In every Duty, Let thy Faith in Chriſt, thy Love to God, and thy Repentance from dead Works be exerciſed. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thy Duties will be more comfortable to thy ſelf. Men that perform Duties in a round, out of cuſtom, or for faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, have no pleaſure therein, are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to them, untoward at them, and careleſs after them. They come to them with trouble, as to that to which their hearts have a reluctancy, and go from them with joy, as from that which was burdenſome and tedious to them. But when men pray with a ſenſe of their wants, and beg mercy, with hope in the blood of Chriſt, and have their love and joy acted in their Duties, how ſweetly do they come off? nay, how pleaſant are they in the very performance of them? Communion with God in them brings peace and comfort indeed. Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> do I adviſe thee to thy hurt, when I adviſe thee to the life of a Saint, to the life of an Angel; to a life of love, and joy, and delight in the Father of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53132:153"/> Mercies, and God of all Conſolations? Is not this Life the Suburbs, the Earneſt, the Firſt-fruits of the life of the Bleſſed, of the life of thoſe heavenly Courtiers, who bathe themſelves without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Springs of Joy, and in Rivers of Pleaſures? And by this care of thine about the manner of performing thy Duties, they will be the more acceptable to God. <hi>He commands the Heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. <hi>delights in truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſal. 51. <hi>and is nigh to them that call upon him in truth,</hi> Pſal. 34. How pleaſing would it be to thee to know thy prayers and readings to be pleaſing to God; <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. <hi>And I will cauſe him to draw near and to approach unto me:</hi> (i. e. with welcome and acceptance,) <hi>for who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me?</hi> If thou bring thy Heart to a Duty, God will bring his Ear to hear thee.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this Uſe, I ſhall, firſt, lay down ſome Arguments or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to inforce it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Lay down the cauſe of theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, which are ſo frequent among us.</p>

               <p>I Begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to move us to mind poſitive Duties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the Law which God hath given us for the Rule of our Lives, is both poſitive and negative; and therefore our Obedience muſt be ſuch. What need poſitive Precepts, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire poſitive Practices? Single Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have ſufficed for a negative Religion. <hi>The Law is holy,</hi> (in its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that immediately concern God) <hi>just,</hi> (in what it commands concerning our Neighbours) <hi>and good,</hi> (in what it commands concerning our ſelves) <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. Look to the Moral Law, every negative command hath a poſitive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Take the Prophets all along that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53132:154"/> ſpeak in the Name of the Lord, and we ſhall find that they ſtill enjoyn Duty, as well as forbid Sin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.29. to the end. <hi>Take heed that thou be not ſnared by following the Nations that are destroyed before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, ſaying, How did theſe Nations ſerve their gods? even ſo will I do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> Here is Sin forbidden: But mark alſo Duty is commanded, <hi>What thing ſoever I command you, obſerve to do it: thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> Nay, a Copy of this Law both poſitive and negative muſt be written out by the Magiſtrate, that we might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; and it was alſo written in a Book by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and put into the Ark, as a witneſs againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> if they ſhould not obſerve it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.24, 25, 26. <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſucceeds <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Charge over the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in his Commands to them both affirmatively and negatively, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 23.7. <hi>Samuel</hi> follows after and ſpeaks the ſame Language, <hi>Serve the Lord with all your heart, fear him, and ſerve him in truth: And turn ye not aſide, for then ye ſhould go after vain things, which cannot profit or deliver, for they are
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53132:155"/> vain,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.20, 21, 24. <hi>David</hi> doth the like, <hi>Depart from evil, and do good,</hi> Pſal. 34.14. <hi>Solomon</hi> writes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Fathers Copy in the very qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of thoſe whom he intreats Mercy for. <hi>If they ſin, and afterwards bethink themſelves, and turn, (i. e.</hi> from their ſins,) <hi>and return unto thee with all the Heart, and with all the Soul, then hear thou from Heaven, from thy Dwelling-place,</hi> 2 Chron. 6.36, to 40. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls on men not only to forſake their evil ways and evil thoughts, but alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> crieth to his people, <hi>Not to oppreſs the Stranger, the Fatherleſs, and the Widows; and alſo throughly to execute Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a man and his Neighbour,</hi> Jer. 7.5, 6. So <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. Our Saviour in his Expoſition of the Law, doth forbid what is Evil, and command what is Good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.43, 44. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>per tot.</hi> The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>Not to be conformed to the World,</hi> there is the Prohibition; <hi>but to be transformed, by the renewing of our mind, proving what is the good, and perfect, and acceptable
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53132:155"/> will of God,</hi> there is the Precept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2. Again, <hi>Put off the works of Darkneſs, put on the armour of Light. Put off the old man, which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deceitful lusts. And put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.23, 24. <hi>Lye not one to another, but ſpeak the truth.</hi> The Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, Religion conſiſteth in Negatives and Poſitives alſo, <hi>James</hi> 1.21, 22, 26, 27. So St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14, 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11, 12. St. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 21, 22, 23. Thus we ſee through the whole <hi>Bible</hi> the Mind of God, by his Meſſengers, to be Poſitive as well as Negative, and this Mind of his he hath ordained to be the rule of our Hearts and Lives; and what ſhall we anſwer when we ſhall be called to an account for our Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? To what purpoſe is a Rule, if it be not followed? and to what end is the Penalty denounced againſt the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, if it be not executed?</p>
               <p>This is the Voice of the Law of God, and therefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> either thou muſt betake thy ſelf to practical godlineſs, or elſe diſown the Scriptures for thy rule
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53132:156"/> and ſquare. Thy Duty muſt (at leaſt in thy deſires and endeavours) carry ſome proportion to thy ſtandard and rule, or elſe thy Religion is a meer cypher, and ſignifieth nothing.</p>
               <p>So far as the beſt come ſhort of the Law they ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Sin is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law.</hi> And that becauſe the Law is given to him as a rule of Life, God hath therefore qualified it with the porperties of a Rule: 1. A Rule muſt be perfect, and not defective, not redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. 2. A Rule muſt be plain, not dark; <hi>All her ways are plain to him that underſtandeth.</hi> 3. A Rule muſt be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and known, otherwiſe it's a ſnare to intrap men. God hath proclaimed his Law; <hi>The Command is not hidden from thee, nor far off,</hi> Deut. 30.11. <hi>It's not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldst ſay, Who ſhall go up for us thither, and fetch it thence, that we may hear it, and do it?</hi> Nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas. <hi>But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart,</hi> (12, 13, 14, verſes,) <hi>that thou mayſt do them.</hi> 4. A Rule is that by which men ſhall be judged, ſo is this Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53132:156"/> 48. <hi>The Word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge you at the last day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Mercies of God to thee are poſitive as well as privative; and why ſhould not thy Duty be ſuitable to the Divine Bounty. God is not only a Shield to defend thee from evil in thy Body, in thy Soul, in thy Perſon, in thy Relations; in thine Out-goings and in thine Incomings, by Night and by Day, at all times, and in all places; but he is alſo a Sun to refreſh thee with good, with temporal good, Food, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Friends, Relations, Sleep, Liberty, Wealth, eſteem in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With ſpiritual good, with Sabbaths, Scriptures, Sacraments, ſeaſons of Grace, with the tenders of Pardon, and Peace, and Adoption, and eternal Salvation, upon excellent and equitable terms. And what reaſon can we give why our Obedience ſhould not bear a proportion to his Beneficence. <hi>He is a Sun and a Shield, and gives Grace and Glory, and with-holdeth no good things from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.</p>
               <p>Shall God with-hold no good thing from thee, and canſt thou find in thy
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53132:157"/> heart to deny the doing of any good thing for him? Is his Bounty of ſo large an extent, as to comprehend protection from all Evil, and the fruition of all good? and muſt thy Duty be ſo narrow and ſcanty, as if he did not deſerve ſo much as he requireth? Is it honeſt to receive or buy in by one Meaſure, and to return and ſell out by another? <hi>Divers Weights and divers Meaſures, both of them are abomination to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Weight and a Weight, a Meaſure and a Meaſure, one to buy with that's large, another to ſell with that is leſs; I only allude to it. It's abominable for thee to receive of God by the largeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to return to him by the leaſt. <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou art born of God, and guilty of theſe partial temporary Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, conſider it ſeriouſly, let ingenuity plead for God. When he firſt wrought upon thy Soul, he did not only tranſlate thee out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs, but alſo bring thee into the Kingdom of his dear Son. He did not only turn thee from Satan, but alſo cauſe thee to return to himſelf. He brought thee out of a ſtate of Wrath, and brought thee into a
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53132:157"/> ſtate of Love and Favour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. He redeemed thee from thoſe Enemies which had carried thee Captive, Sin, Satan, Death, Hell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> But this is not all, he hath alſo <hi>brought thee into the glorious liberty of the Children of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 12. 1 Joh. 3.1. He hath delivered thee from this preſent evil World, (that its affrightments, its allurements, that all its power and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall not be able to deſtroy thee,) but this is not all, he hath made thee an Heir of a better World. Of a Child of the Devil, thou art made a Child of God, of a Slave to ſin, a Citizen of <hi>Sion;</hi> nay, he doth not only free thee from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the curſe of the Law; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo give thee the bleſſing of eternal life in and with himſelf among his innumerable Company of Angels, and the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Firſt-born. Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> judge whether it be not very diſingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to receive from God all ſorts of Mercies, and to give to God not half the Duties we owe to him. How canſt thou mete to God one meaſure, and expect from him another? Friend, God doth not
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53132:158"/> put thee off with half-Happineſs; and why ſhouldſt thou put him off with half-Holineſs?</p>

               <p n="3">3. COnſider Chriſt died to purchaſe poſitive as well as negative godlineſs for men; and wilt thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint him of the Fruits of his Death? Indeed, if it had been poſſible for him to have bought mans deliverance from ſin, without the re-impreſſion of Gods Image on the Soul, he had been but half a Saviour, and made us at the moſt but half happy: But according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles phraſe, he ſaves perfectly, or to the utmoſt, upon all accounts, and in all reſpects, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, bought man off from ſin, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Service of God. He redeems us from ſin: <hi>We are redeemed,</hi> ſaith the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53132:158"/> Apoſtle, <hi>from our vain Converſation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by tradition from our Fathers. Not with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. He redeems alſo unto his own Service, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. of the ſame <hi>Epiſtle, He ſuffered, the Juſt for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, to bring us to God.</hi> He died, that we might die to ſin; and he died, that we might live to God. He ſuffered, to bring us off from our curſed loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Luſts; and he ſuffered, to bring us to the Fear, and Love, and Service of the bleſſed and glorious Lord. We have both theſe ends of our Saviours Sufferings mention'd in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf</hi> (his Death is called a <hi>giving himſelf,</hi> becauſe it was voluntary, and a freewill Offering) <hi>for us,</hi> (here is his Paſſion; but what ends had he in his eye? truly both theſe,) <hi>that he might redeem us from all Iniquity,</hi> (make us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively religious, in freeing us from the bondage of ſin) <hi>and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works;</hi> i. e. make them poſitively holy. None are purified without poſitive qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53132:159"/> and gracious habits in the Soul. To be purified unto himſelf, is to be thus qualified for the honour and ſervice of Chriſt. And to make it more plain, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>To purifie unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people,</hi> (a people that ſhall diſown all other Lords, and all other Work, and ſhall be his Servants, and do his Work only,) <hi>zealous of good works.</hi> He did not die only to make men good, and to enable men to do good; but alſo to cauſe them to do good with heat, and heart, and fervency of Spirit. Nay, it is evident, that to make men poſitively pious, was the main and principal end of his Paſſion; and that his delivering us from ſin, was only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, to his adorning us with Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As a man cannot put on new Robes till he hath firſt put off his old Rags, ſo a man cannot put on the new man, the beautiful Image of the heavenly, till he hath put off the old man, the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Image of the earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> Luke 1.74, 75. <hi>We are delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, that we ſhould ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our lives.</hi> He plougheth up the fallow
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53132:159"/> ground of the Heart, and kills the weeds of ſin, in order to the caſting in the ſeed of Grace into the Soul.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> conſider, if Chriſt died to purchaſe poſitive Holineſs for thee; what hope canſt thou have of an intereſt in his Death without it? Canſt thou think he bought one for thee without the other, or that thou mayſt be a partial ſharer in his Death? And what wilt thou do without an intereſt in his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings? Except he waſh thee in his blood, thou haſt no part in him; and if thou haſt no part in him, thy part muſt be among Devils and damned Spirits. Again, wilt thou by thy Omiſſions deny and deprive Chriſt of that Service, which he hath bought ſo dearly? Alas, how little is it that thou art able to do for him, when thou doſt all thou canſt! And how much did that coſt him? what pangs and throws did he bear? what rage from men? what wrath from God? how did he wraſtle with the Frowns and Fury, with the Power and Policy of the World and Hell? And after all this, doſt thou grudge him that poor Service, for which he was hungry, and thirſty,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53132:160"/> and weary, and tempted, and betrayed, and crucified? <hi>Whether we live,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we live to the Lord; whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live or die, we are the Lords. To this end Jeſus died and roſe again, that he might be Lord both of the Dead and Living,</hi> Rom. 14.7, 8. Thou wouldſt take it ill thy ſelf to be denied the Service of that, for which thou haſt ſo dearly paid. O think of it, when thou art guilty of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the matter or manner of Duties, I now rob Jeſus Chriſt of that which he bought with his moſt precious blood, and let him ſee the travail of his Soul upon thee, and be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider the Priviledges thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeſt call aloud upon thee to mind po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Holineſs, and to do good as well as to forbear evil. I am ſure thy Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are poſitive, and ſo ſhould thy Piety be. What is the Goſpel but a Cabinet of precious Jewels, a River of living water, a Caſe of the richeſt and coſtlieſt Cordials, a Counterpart of Heavens eternal Court-Rolls, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> or kindneſs of God to Mankind, wherein are all ſorts of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53132:160"/> bleſſings for Body and Soul in every condition treaſur'd up. The enjoyment of it is a ſpecial ſingular Priviledge, the Miniſtration of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8, 9. The Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs far above the Legal Miniſtration. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, The Laws God gave to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were a ſpecial diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy; <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and his Judgments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Iſrael: <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with every Nation;</hi> as for his Judgments they have not known them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. But his Goſpel-Diſpenſation is an higher and greater Favour. But what doth this Goſpel-Priviledge call for? ſurely poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as well as negative godlineſs. <hi>The Grace of God</hi> (the Goſpel is ſo called, becauſe it declares it to us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. and intereſts us in it as an Inſtrument thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>which bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> (which proclaimeth Life upon holy Conditions) <hi>teacheth us, that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts,</hi> (Commiſſions againſt the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, but that is not all,) <hi>we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly</hi> (righteouſly towards men, ſoberly in
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53132:161"/> relation to our ſelves, godly in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that concern God,) <hi>in this preſent evil world.</hi> The Goſpel allows of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions no more than the Law, and is ſo far from indulging men in ſin, becauſe it hath mercy for the penitent Sinner, that it addeth ſtronger Obligations to Obedience, and threatneth more ſevere condemnation to the Diſobedient, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15, 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Again, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which have in their bowels all the good of Heaven and Earth, all the bleſſings of this Life and a better, which are as much worth as both worlds, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. which are exceeding great (in their quantity) and precious, (in their quality) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and the peculiar portion of Gods own Children, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. who are the only Heirs of them, and all others ſtrangers to them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore miſerable, and in an hopeleſs and deſperate Condition. Theſe Promiſes are ſo far from excuſing or exempting from theſe poſitive Duties, that they engage us the more firmly to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore, dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, theſe Promiſes,</hi> (that God will be our Father, and we ſhall be his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

                  <hi>&amp;c. Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18.) <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all pollutions of Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> (but this is not all) <hi>and perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> The Promiſes do not only bind to Purity, but alſo to Proficiency therein, till we come to perfection; <hi>And perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> The Covenant of Grace, which is a Mine of unſearchable Riches, a Book wherein every leaf, nay every line ſpeaks Love and Life; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more mercy in it (even the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God) than Heaven and Earth are able to contain; this requires poſitive as well as negative holineſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17. nay it engageth for both, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>From all your Idols and from all your filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will I cleanſe you:</hi> But more than this, 26, 27, <hi>verſes, I will take away your heart of ſtone, and give you a heart of fleſh. I will put my Spirit into you, and ye ſhall keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and do them.</hi> So that all theſe Priviledges are to no purpoſe, if we be not provoked by them to do good, and perform the Duties which are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of them. <hi>Reader,</hi> think of it, why ſhould God give thee Precepts, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee about the matter and manner
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53132:162"/> of performing thy Duties and Promiſes, to encourage thee to diligence and faithfulneſs therein, if thou mayſt live in the Omiſſion of them? Surely ſuch infinite coſt calls for ſome great care and conſcienciouſneſs in thy Converſation. Might not God by virtue of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over thee, as grand Proprietor of the Univerſe, have required this at thine hands? but when he is ſo gracious as to ſue to thee, and to allure thee, and ſeek to draw thee by ſuch Cords of love, wilt thou ſtand out and deny him? O bluſh for ſhame, that thou haſt neglected ſo long the wooings, and beſeechings, and intreaties of ſuch a glorious Goſpel, and ſuch precious Promiſes, and ſuch an ineſtimable Covenant! The greater the Charge God is at with thee, the greater ſhould be the Service thou doſt him. Where the ground is well dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dreſſed, and watered, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured, a greater Crop is expected by the Huſbandman. I muſt tell thee, Friend, that thou wilt one day find, <hi>That to whom much is given, of him much will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> (Luke 12.48.) and that God expects Returns anſwerable to thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53132:162"/> Do not imagine, as ſome vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done, that the bare enjoyment of theſe Priviledges will ſave thee; I muſt tell thee, and that from Gods own mouth, they will be ſo far from it, that they will make Hell fire the hotter for thee, and much deepen thine eternal condemnation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21, 22, 23. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.3, 4. <hi>Amend your ways and yours doings, and truſt not in lying words, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe.</hi> Such Priviledges without poſitive holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do but uſher men to an hotter Hell.</p>

And, Friend, will you pretend to be Gods Servant, and neglect his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs? This is but to put a mock and cheat upon him; like him in the Goſpel, who when he was bid go work in the Vineyard, ſaid, <hi>I go, but went not. If I be a Maſter, where is your fear,</hi> Mal. 1.7. If God be your Maſter, where is your fear of diſpleaſing him, either by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting what he enjoyns, or doing what he forbids.

And thou ſeeſt the loweſt Beings, Gods Servants, do not only forbear doing evil, but after their manner, analogically they do good, and poſitively, ſerve God; and wilt thou content thy ſelf with a bare forbearance of what is evil, and be ſhamed by inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Creatures, who according to their natures in their places do good. Why doſt thou call thy ſelf a Chriſtian, if thou wilt not follow the pattern of Chriſt? and how canſt thou profeſs thy ſelf Gods Servant, if thou wilt not do him Service? <hi>Know ye not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that to whom ye yield your ſelves Servants to obey, his Servants ye are to whom ye obey,</hi> Rom. 6.16. Either obey God as a Servant ought, or diſown him to be thy Maſter. Can he be ſaid to be thy Servant, who neglects thy work, though he do thee no miſchief? Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Servant in this reſpect may as properly be ſaid to be thine; for as he

Wouldſt not thou think him a fooliſh Huſbandman, that ſhould take care for the caſting out the ſtones, and plucking up the weeds out of his ground, and then loſe all his coſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53132:165"/> and pains for want of ſowing it with good ſeed? Would it not vex a Scrivener, after he had taken much pains, and ſpent much time about a large Deed, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, after he had taken great care to write it fair, without any blots, to be forced to write all over again, for his omiſſion of ſome material paſſage in it? The Apoſtle writes to the Elect Lady, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Look to your ſelves that we loſe not thoſe things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</hi> If he that doth not perſevere in well-doing, may deprive himſelf of all the benefit of his good deeds which he hath already done; what benefit can they expect, who never began to do good?

Thou haſt no work of Faith, or labour of Love, or patience of Hope, or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in Prayer, or breathings and longings after conformity to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the bleſſed God for Chriſt to Record and Reward. The Holy Ghoſt when he tells us, <hi>That God will render to every man according to his deeds,</hi> preſently ſubjoyns, <hi>To them who by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent continuance in well-doing</hi> (i. e. poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Holineſs,) <hi>ſeek for Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Immortality, everlaſting life,</hi> Rom. 2.6, 7. <hi>Virtutis eſt magis honeſta agere quam non turpia,</hi> as he ſaid well. It's rather the property of Virtue to do things laudable, than not to do things loathſome.</p>
               <p>A negative Chriſtian in Gods account is no Chriſtian; and though he may ſtand for ſomewhat among men (that are no better than himſelf) yet he is a meer Cypher in the account of God. God ſeeth that as he is not outwardly
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53132:166"/> bad, ſo he is not inwardly good; and that he is at a greater diſtance from Piety than from Prophaneneſs, and he looking moſt to the heart and bent thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. muſt needs loath a filthy unclean Conſcience under a fair civil Converſation.</p>
               <p>A Tree may be full of Vermine, when the green leaves may hide them from the eyes of men. So the vermine of Pride, and Unbelief, and Hypocriſie, may crawl in thy Heart, though thy civility may hide them from the ſight or ſuſpicion of thy fellow Creatures. We ſay, <hi>All is not Gold that gliſters,</hi> much leſs is ſhining-civility ſincere ſanctity. The <hi>Jews</hi> who obeyed ſome of Gods Laws, becauſe they lived in the wilful breach of others, are ſaid <hi>to have done nothing of all his Commands,</hi> Jer. 32.23. <hi>And they came in, and poſſeſſed it (i. e.</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan) but they obeyed not thy Voice, nor walked in thy Law: They have done nothing of all that thou commandedſt them to do.</hi> It ſeems ſtrange that the Indictment ſhould run ſo high, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of the breach of every Law, and the neglect of every poſitive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept?
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53132:166"/> ſurely the <hi>Jews</hi> offer'd Sacrifice, circumciſed their Children, kept the Paſsover, obſerved their new Moons and Sabbaths, and did many things which God commanded them to do; and yet here they are charged to do nothing that God commanded them to do. Truly, becauſe they had not a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious eye to every known Duty, but allowed themſelves in the Omiſſion of ſome, God reckons that they obey'd him in none, and deals with them as if they had done nothing of all that he commanded them. Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> if they who perform ſome poſitive Duties, are counted by God as performing none, if they wilfully neglect any, what a pitiful nothing will God reckon thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if it be wholly negative, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any poſitive Obedience at all. Though braſs Coin be not ſo bad as Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern, yet not being ſo good as Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it's little accounted. Though thou art not as bad as the ſcandalous, yet if thou art not as good as the truly pious God will not eſteem thee. For what is highly eſteemed of men, may be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the ſight of God.</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:53132:167"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> weigh this Argument; wouldſt thou loſe all the pains thou takeſt to forbear what is evil? art thou contented to work all thy days at the Labour-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain? Canſt thou be ſatisfied that thy negative Religion ſhould be counted at the Great Day a Nullity, or no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all? Little doſt thou think how deep it will cut thy heart to find thy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility judged by God himſelf to be but varniſhed Heatheniſm, or gliſtering Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. The young man who was more than a meer negative Chriſtian, thought his condition ſafe and ſound; but when Chriſt diſcover'd him inſincere, he went away as heavily as he came to him haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Probably thy hopes are great; but I muſt tell thee, thy diſappointment will be the more grievous; when thou ſhalt find thy ſelf deceived, and that thou haſt all thy life long been a labourious Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and done nothing. The greater riſe thine expectation had, and the higher thy hope was, the more bruiſing will thy fall be, and the heavier thy heart for ever.</p>

               <p n="7">7. COnſider God deſerves your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Obedience as well as your Negative. Friend, if God hath thy negative Obedience, ſome other hath thy poſitive, (for I cannot ſuppoſe thee idle all the time of thy life) either the Devil, or the World, or the Fleſh: Man cannot live without a Maſter, whoſe work and buſineſs he will do. Now let thy Conſcience judge which of theſe deſerves thy Service beſt. If as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſaid (when asked of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, who ſhould inherit them after his death,) <hi>Let them be given to the moſt worthy.</hi> Thou wilt for the future give thy Affections and Converſation to the moſt worthy, I doubt not but thou wilt quickly give them to God. For the Devil, ſurely thou wilt not for ſhame put
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53132:168"/> him in compoſition with God. Is not he an old Serpent, ſolicitous night and day with his wiles, and ſnares, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, to deceive thee? And is not he a roaring Lion, ſeeking continually how he may devour thee? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. Is not his emnity ſuch againſt God, that he hates thee for his ſake, and improves all his power and policy to bring thee to be a partaker of the ſame miſery and wretchedneſs with himſelf? and is he fit to be thy Maſter? Art thou willing to be his Servant? yet I muſt tell thee, if thou wilfully neglecteſt the work of God, thou art of thy Father the Devil, if the Devil and his works thou doſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. And remember, the Redeemer had not died to ſubdue the Devil to us, if it had not been cruel bondage for man to be enſlaved to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>For the world, what is in it that ſhould deſerve thy ſervice? I am ſure God made the World for thee, and not thee for the World; and the end is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the means: God made the World to ſerve thee, and not thee to ſerve the World. Is it Riches that thou
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53132:168"/> payeſt thy Homage to? Ah how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferior are they to thy ſpiritual Soul! Is it not a rare lovely ſight to ſee a noble Heaven-born immortal Spirit truckle, and bow, and ſubmit, and be a drudge and ſlave to white and yellow duſt, to the guts and garbage of the Earth? Is not this a fine ſight thinkſt thou, for thy Love and Deſires, and Joys and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, like Moles to be grovelling in the Earth, when high and noble Objects worthy of them are always before thee expecting them?</p>
               <p>Or is it the Honour of the World which thou adoreſt? Doſt thou know what an Idol thou haſt ſet up in thine heart? A Vapor, a Wind, the ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath of a company of ignorant vile people, who underſtand nothing of true worth or excellency. Where is this? or what is this God whom thou worſhippeſt? a faſhion, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53132:169"/> It's as a Picture to the Eye, which hath ſome ſhape, but no life. In brief, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World is ſo poor, ſo pitiful, ſo inconſiderable a thing, that a wiſe man would not give a farthing for it.</p>
               <p>Or is it Pleaſure, that bewitching Bait, that ſugred Poiſon, which hath caught and kill'd many? Thou knoweſt not what thou doſt, when as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thou ſervest divers lusts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> (Tit. 3.2, 3.) reckoning it as the miſery of man by nature. What is this pleaſure, but the ſatisfaction of thy ſenſes, and the delight thou haſt therein, which the Beaſts may enjoy above thee. Let Conſcience judge, are brutiſh Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures worthy to domineer and bear ſway over a mind that is large enough to graſp both Worlds, and an heart capable of the Joys and Pleaſures of glorious and bleſſed Angels? <hi>Reader,</hi> if the World were worthy to be thy Maſter, or its Treaſures, or Honours, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, did deſerve thy Service, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer might have ſpared his pains and paſſion, when he gave himſelf to this preſent evil World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Or is it the Fleſh thou art ſo fond of?
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53132:169"/> why, that's but a poor piece; it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and will cozen thee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. It hath ſuch a depth of deceit in it, that neither thou nor any other Creature can fadom it. And is it good to be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to ſo treacherous a Maſter? it's dying, and will forſake thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. It muſt ſhortly be laid in the duſt, become food for Worms; nay, be turn'd into duſt. And canſt thou think this clod of Clay, this lump of Earth, this ſink of Filthineſs, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of crawling Vermine, a fit Maſter to rule over a Soul that is of Coeleſtial extraction, of a ſpiritual ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Nature, and of an eternal duration. Surely, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou art no debtor to the Fleſh, to live after the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. Thou oweſt thy Fleſh nothing, but care and watchfulneſs to keep it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to ſubdue it, that it lord it not over thy Spirit. If thou ſerveſt the Fleſh once, thou ſerveſt it too much by once; for thou art no debtor to it, and doſt not ow it the leaſt Service ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, but in ſubordination to thy Soul and Saviour: Surely then, if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil, nor the World, nor
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53132:170"/> the Fleſh deſerve thy poſitive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, God muſt. <hi>Reader,</hi> let me come up a little cloſer to thee; I pray who hath laid moſt Obligations on thee, God or they? To whom art thou moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to God or to them? Did they give thee thy Being, when thou waſt nothing? Did they form thee and faſhion thee in thy Mothers Womb? Was it by them that thou waſt born? Did they look after thee in thine Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and cauſe Mercy all along to grow up with thee? Have any of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected thee in thy Dangers, ſupported thee in thy Difficulties, ſupplied thee in thy Wants, or deliver'd thee out of thy Diſtreſſes? Who ſpreads thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and bleſſeth thy Food to thee every day? Who makes thy Bed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth ſleep for thee every night? Whoſe mercy is it thou liveſt, Gods or theirs? and through whoſe compaſſion is it that thou art not conſumed? Whoſe viſitation is it that preſerveth thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Who defendeth thee night and day from Devils and damned Spirits, who watch continually to drag thee to their own Den and Dungeon of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53132:170"/> Darkneſs, and who hath relieved thee with all the Mercies which ever thou haſt enjoyed? and is all this nothing to ingage thee to his Service? Doth all this care of thee deſerve nothing from thee again to God? But, Friend, to come up one ſtep nearer to thee; Did God, or any of them, ſend his only begotten Son to redeem thee out of the hands of the Law and Divine Juſtice, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for thee a ſtate of Peace, and Love, and Adoption, and everlaſting Life? Did they, or any of them, bear the Curſe of the Law, and the Wrath of an infinite Majeſty, and the Rage of the Fiends of Darkneſs, to deliver thee from them, and to make thee bleſſed? O <hi>Reader,</hi> where are thy Wits? what is become of thine Underſtanding? If he that ſends thee in all the good thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeſt, and freeth thee from all the evil thou eſcapeſt, doth not deſerve all thou haſt and art; who doth I know not. Haſt thou laid the thouſandth part of thoſe Obligations on any Child or Servant thou haſt, which God hath on thee? Didſt thou make them? doſt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them? canſt thou redeem them?
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53132:171"/> Alas, thou art but a poor Inſtrument in the hand of God, to convey ſome ſmall matters to them; yet thou expecteſt poſitive as well as negative Obedience from them; and why ſhould not God, who hath laid ſuch millions of Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on thee, look for the like from thee? Once more, to whom wilt thou call in thy day of Diſtreſs? To whom wilt thou cry in thy time of trouble, to God, or any of thoſe three fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Maſters, is it to them, or to God that thou wilt lift up thy Hands, and Eyes, and Heart on thy ſick, on thy dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bed, when all thy Friends and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred will be inſignificant and helpleſs to thee, and Devils will wait on thee to devour thee? Who is it that offereth thee an unchangeable ſtate of Pleaſure and Happineſs upon excellent and equitable terms, that intreats, and invites, and wooeth, and courteth thee to accept of freedom from miſery, and Hell flames, and eternal damnation; and alſo to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his tenders of fulneſs of joy, and a Crown of Life, and a Kingdom of Glory for ever and ever? Ah Friend, little doſt thou know how much thou
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53132:171"/> oweſt the bleſſed God. I am ſure thou canſt not deny him any part of thy Heart or Life, if thou wilt give him what he deſerves, thy Conſcience muſt tell thee that it is his due. And then if thou wilt give every one his due, why ſhouldſt thou put by the glorious Lord? If thy Friends, thy Neighbours, thine Enemies, all muſt have their due: I beſeech thee do not deny God, but let him have thy poſitive Obedience, which is unqueſtionably his due.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Conſider Sanctification, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or ſound-ſaving Converſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in poſitive as well as negative Holineſs; nay, more eſpecially and principally in poſitive Holineſs, as that which conſummateth and perfecteth the work. And how then canſt thou have any grounded hope that thy condition is ſafe without it? When the Prophet mentions that Repentance which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be repented of, that Repentance which ſhall find Mercy, and obtain Pardon; he enjoyneth both, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.7. An averſion from Sin, and a Converſion to God, as their ſupream and chiefeſt good. When the Apoſtle
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53132:172"/> mentions that Sanctification, which is the inſeparable concomitant of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the conſtant effect of our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, he mentions both. <hi>Reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead unto ſin,</hi> (freed from it Laws, as a dead Wife from the Laws of her Huſband, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled unto its Service, as a dead man is unto the actions of life; here is negative Holineſs,) <hi>but alive unto God,</hi> (obliged unto his Laws, as a living Subject is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Laws of his Soveraign, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled unto his Service, as a living man is unto actions that are ſuitable to life; here is poſitive Holineſs,) <hi>through Chriſt.</hi> This is the root upon which Sanctification groweth as the fruit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. So <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Being then made free from Sin, ye became the Servants of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Being deliver'd from the former Uſurper, they became obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their rightful Lord, and ſerved him.</p>
               <p>Now, Friend, what wilt thou do for an evidence of Repentance and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which are of ſuch abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that thou canſt not be ſaved without them, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53132:172"/> If thou neglecteſt poſitive godlineſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thou mayſt flatter thy ſelf with an hypocritical Repentance, but a ſincere one reſpects both parts of the Law. An <hi>Hebrician</hi> obſerves that in the word <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> which ſignifieth upright or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; there is a great <hi>Tau,</hi> to note that an upright man obſerveth, the whole Law, from the firſt to the laſt letter thereof. He may be too critical, but this is certain, the true Penitent chooſeth the way of Obedience, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the way of Diſobedience. He is deſcribed by this Character, <hi>He chooſeth the things that pleaſe God,</hi> Iſa. 56.4. He doth not only refuſe the things that diſpleaſe God, but alſo chooſe the things that pleaſe him; yea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they pleaſe him. The natural Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, what he is, from the good tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body, which makes him more gentle and pliable than otherwiſe he would be. The moral Religioniſt is, what he is, from the improvement, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſimprovement of his natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Civilian is, what he is, from fear of man, or out of reſpect to man; <hi>He is ſtill in the bond of Iniquity;</hi> but he
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53132:173"/> is ſo careful to line his Fetters, that they do not clink to the diſturbance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to his own ſhame. But the true Chriſtian is what he is from Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of, and love to the Will of God; and as he at his firſt implantation into Chriſt brings forth this good fruit, ſo he continueth in it to the end of his life. <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit,</hi> Joh. 15.5.</p>
               <p>As Naturaliſts obſerve of the Bees, that they are laborious in their youth, and do not diſpenſe with themſelves to be idle in their age; but as they increaſe in dextrouſneſs, ſo alſo in laboriouſneſs, being more early at work than the younger; nay, when their Bodies are over-ſpent, and their wings ragged, they will venture abroad to work, though they often prove too weak to return home. Thus the right Convert flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as the Palm-Tree in his youth, <hi>and is fat and flouriſhing, and brings forth fruit in his old age,</hi> Pſal. 92.12, 13, 14.</p>

COnſider, if God ſhould omit his care of thee, and neglect thee as often as thou omitteſt his Service, and neglecteſt him; nay, if he ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his poſitive Providence from thee one moment, what would become of thee? thy Body would be turn'd into a dead loathſome Carkaſs, and thy Soul would be haled by Devils to Hell fire. Is it not more juſt that God ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thee, than that thou ſhouldſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect him? and hath he not much more reaſon to neglect thee a moment, than thou haſt to neglect him days, and moneths, and years?

All he doth for thee is mercy, meer mercy; not only beyond but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to merit: All he requireth of thee,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53132:174"/> and all thou canſt do for him, is Duty, and that which the greateſt Juſtice calls upon thee for. Now if thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be neglected by God, why ſhouldſt thou not be as unwilling to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect God? Is thy ſafety of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern than his Glory? or muſt thy Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be prefer'd before his? Wilt thou not make that golden Rule of Chriſt the rule of thy actions with men, to deal with them as thou wouldſt have them to deal with thee; and wilt thou deal otherwiſe with the bleſſed God? Muſt he remember thee at all times, in all conditions; keep thee night and day, leſt any hurt thee, ſupport and ſupply thee every moment, and thou forget him days without number? Is this fair or honeſt dealing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Let me tell thee, upon him thou liveſt, by him thou moveſt, and from him thou haſt thy Being. Thou canſt not think, or ſpeak, or act in the leaſt, if he ſhould ſuſpend his care of thee; thine Eyes could not ſee, nor thine Ears hear, nor thy Mouth taſt, nor thy Hands or Feet move, if his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doth not concur to them. If
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53132:174"/> he ſhould but with-draw his manute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, and the hold he hath of thee for the ſmalleſt pittance of time, thou wouldſt drop into the bottomleſs Pit. The flames do not depend more on the Fire, nor the ſtreams on the Spring of water, than thy Life, and all thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for this and the other World do upon God; and wilt thou provoke him to leave thee? He hath ſaid, <hi>with the froward he will ſhew himſelf froward,</hi> Pſal. 18.26. That he will walk contrary to them that walk contrary to him,<note place="margin">Lev. 26.24.</note> and that he will forſake them that forſake him, and pay men in their own Coin;<note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.2.</note> and wilt thou venture him any longer? Others have felt the truth of thoſe threatnings, and doſt thou think to go unpuniſhed? Surely if common ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not move thee to remember him night and day, who remembreth thee with Loving-kindneſs every minute; yet the Divine Severity may fright thee from forgetting him, leſt he forget thee for ever. Believe it, if he leave thee, Wrath, and Death, and Hell, and Damnation, and Devils will ſoon find thee. Thou canſt now depart from him, by thy
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53132:175"/> neglect of his Worſhip, and be merry and chearful notwithſtanding; but if once he depart from thee, though but for a moment, thou art undone eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Woe be to thee, when I depart from you,</hi> Hoſ. 9.12. Thy Friends, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and Creature-Comforts may depart from thee, and it may be well with thee; but if the Fountain of thy Life, the God of thy Health, the Father of all Mercies depart from thee, woe will be to thee. Heaven and Earth cannot make him bleſſed, or hinder him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly curſed, whom God leaves and forſakes. Alas, if the Heavens omit to give us its ſhowers, or the Sun omit to diſpenſe its influences, or the Earth omit to yield its increaſe; where are we? what can we do? how lamentable is our condition? Thoſe Perſons that were purer than Snow, that were whiter than Milk, that were more ruddy than Rubies, or than poliſhed Saphires, their Viſage is blacker than a coal: <hi>They are not known in the ſtreets, their Skin cleaveth to their Bones, it is withered, it is become like a ſtick,</hi> Lament. 4.7, 8. <hi>The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and the Sucklings ſwoon in the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53132:175"/> ſtreets,</hi> Lam. 2.11, 12. But if our caſe be ſo woful, when Creatures omit their accuſtomed kindneſs to us, what will it be if God ſhould omit his care of us?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Conſider, If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould omit the leaſt in the Work of thy Redemption, thou wouldſt be undone for ever. Had Chriſt been as unwilling to ſave thee to the uttermoſt, as thou art to ſerve him to the uttermoſt, what would have become of thee? Friend, Jeſus Chriſt trod the whole Wine-preſs of his Fathers Wrath alone; had he left but one drop of that bitter Cup of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath for thee to drink, it would have cauſed thy Belly to ſwell, and Bowels to be troubled, and Bones to ake, and whole Body and Soul to ſuffer extremity of Torments for ever. When Chriſt undertook to interpoſe between thee and his Father, to ſtand as a ſkreen between thy poor Soul and a conſuming Fire, he omitted not the leaſt that was requiſite for thy good. Though it was hard work, painful work, amazing work, ſuch work as neither Men nor Angels durſt undertake; yet when thy Miſeries and Neceſſities required it, he did it.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53132:176"/> He did not omit to contend with Earth, and Heaven, and Hell for thee: He did not omit to drink of the Brook in the way, of the Cup of his Fathers Wrath, and to tread the Wine-preſs of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger alone, that he might obtain Favour and Life for thee. He omitted not the leaſt in point of ſatisfaction to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Juſtice, he deſired not the ſmalleſt abatement of thoſe vaſt ſums which thou thou didſt ow to the Divine Majeſty, but paid the utmoſt farthing for thee. He never gave over till all was finiſhed, till all the Tipes were verified, all the Promiſes accompliſhed, and all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Father fully anſwered, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.28. He omitted nothing in point of application of the Purchaſe which he had bought for Sinners. <hi>As he died to make ſatisfaction for us, ſo he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</hi> As he died to make his Will good, (for a Will is not of force as long as the Teſtator li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.17.) wherein he gives Pardon, and Love, and Life to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo he liveth to ſee his Will made good, that his choſen might enjoy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his boundleſs Love and Grace
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53132:176"/> had bequeathed to them. He died, that he might be a legal Teſtator; and he liveth, that he might be his own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> did Chriſt omit nothing which related to thy Salvation, and wilt thou omit any thing that relates to his Service? Did he not ſhrink back when thy Miſeries call'd him to bear that burden which made the Earth to quake, the whole Creation to groan, and would have broke the backs of Angels and Arch-Angels, and all the heavenly Hoſt, if they had put their ſhoulders under it; and wilt thou ſhrink back from that eaſie Yoke and light Burden, which he calls thee to take upon thee? Is this thy kindneſs to thy Friend? <hi>Why doſt thou uſe him thus,</hi> as <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaid to <hi>Huſhai.</hi> Is this thy grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, why doſt thou ſerve him ſo? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.17.</p>
               <p>When the moſt righteous God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded full ſatifaction for the breach of his Law, by the Nature that had tranſgreſſed it, and reſolved, that if he had it not, the whole Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould periſh; when his Wrath
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53132:177"/> was breaking in like a Flood to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the whole World of Mankind, and neither Man nor Angel durſt ſtand in the breach to divert this deluge of Fury, when the Knife of the Laws Curſe was even at the Creatures throat, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s at the throat of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Thy Redeemer call'd to his Father, O Father, Father, hold thine hand, ſlay not thoſe poor Creatures; I have provided a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ſuch as thou wilt accept. I know that Beeves, and Goats, and Lambs are not the Sacrifices for Sin which thou wouldſt have, (what proportion hath the blood of Beaſts to the infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of Sin) but I know what Sacrifice thou wouldſt have; thou wouldſt have me to offer my ſelf upon the Croſs as a Sacrifice to thy Juſtice, (that the whole World might know the Holineſs of thy Nature, the Righteouſneſs of thy Law, and thine infinite kindneſs to thine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,) <hi>Well, I come to do thy Will, O God.</hi> Though the Taſk be ſo great, and the Work ſo grievous, that no other dares ſo much as touch it; and though I am wholly free, and none can oblige or compel me to it, yet I will undertake it.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53132:177"/> Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> was Chriſt ſo forward, ſo willing to obey ſuch a Command of dying a curſed, painful, ſhameful death, that he tells his Father, <hi>I delight to do thy Will, O God;</hi> and art thou ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to obey his Commands, and to walk in his ways, <hi>When his ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all his paths are peace,</hi> Pſal. 40.6. Heb. 10.5. Prov. 3.17. Was Chriſt ſo careful and tender of thee, that he would not omit any thing needful for thy good; and art thou ſo careleſs and forgetful of him, as to omit that which is of ſuch concernment to his Glory? Friend, bethink thy ſelf, doth not thy Redeemer deſerve fairer dealings at thy hands? Heathens and Publicans would not be ſo baſe and unworthy to their Friends and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors.</p>

As the Branches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from the Root that ſap and moiſture which enableth them to fruitfulneſs; ſo the Chriſtian draweth that Virtue from Chriſt, even in his firſt Converſion, that inclines him whilſt he lives to bring forth fruit to God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We are his Workmanſhip, created in Jeſus Chriſt unto good Works, which God hath ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> Mark, this new piece that is indeed Gods Maſter-piece (for the New Creation doth far excel the old Heavens and Earth,) is formed in Chriſt as the efficient Cauſe unto good Works, unto ſuch Works as flow from the Spirit of God as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as are according to the Will of God, as the Rule, and for the Glory of God as the end, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11.</p>

               <p>Beſides, the true Convert hath the Law of God written in his Heart, which cannot but move him to the obſervation of the Law in his Life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the predominant principles that are in every mans nature, ſuch are
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53132:180"/> his inclinations, whether to God or evil, and ſuch are ordinarily his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As a bowl moves this way or that way, according as the Byaſs inclines.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> Conſider, either thou art a Believer or not: If thou art not, it concerns thee ſpeedily to look about thee, leſt thou die in this eſtate, and be damned for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> If thou art a Believer, it would be very ſtrange for thee to continue in any Omiſſion, for all this while thou acteſt againſt thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It's very much eaſier to ſin with thy nature than againſt it. A wicked man that hath knowledge, cannot ſin with ſuch pleaſure and eaſineſs as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he doth in ſinning oppoſe and fight with Conſcience within him; but it ſeems harder for thee, for thou doſt not only offer violence to thine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Conſcience, but alſo to the new Nature that is implanted in thee. By thy Omiſſions, thou doſt not only ſin againſt thy natural Light, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy new ſpiritual Life. It's hard, we ſay, for a man to thwart or croſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Naturam expellas furca,</hi> &amp;c. and wilt thou take ſuch pains to diſobey thy
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53132:180"/> Gods Precepts? The Devils Servants do his Will, but it is with their own whole Wills, according to their own inclinations; they do not croſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to pleaſe him. But thou canſt not neglect the Will of God, but it muſt be in part againſt thine own will, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thine own inclinations; and wilt thou diſpleaſe thy ſelf to diſpleaſe God, and walk contrary to thy ſelf, that thou mayſt walk contrary to God. This is the part and guiſe of the moſt ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, envious, and malicious Enemies, and I am ſure it's impoſſible for thee (if a Believer) to be ſuch an enemy to God. God did purpoſely endue thee with a new Spirit, that thou mighteſt live to his praiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. <hi>This people have I formed for my ſelf, and</hi> (new made and moulded them) <hi>they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi> Now how is the praiſe of God ſpread in the World, but by good Works, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before others, that they ſeeing your good works, may glorifie your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8.</p>
               <p>Again, it would be marvailous if thou ſhouldſt not follow thy own natural
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53132:181"/> propenſity and inclinations. For a dead man to lie ſtill, and not ſtir, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any actions of life, is nothing ſtrange, none expecteth any other; but for a living man, one that hath a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life to do ſo, would be accounted little leſs than miraculous. For a man dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, that hath no Spirit of Grace to enliven his poor Soul, to lie ſtill in his idleneſs, and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and carnal ſecurity, and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the performance of the Duties of a ſpiritual Life, is no wonder; but is it not a wonder for one that is quickened in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. created unto good works, fitted and formed for them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. that hath Jeſus Chriſt living in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. and a principle of holineſs inclining and inabling him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſhould omit thoſe actions that are proper to life. I beſeech thee, Friend, do not diſpleaſe thy ſelf, and croſs thy very Nature, to diſobey thy God; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is worthy of more dutiful behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from thee.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Reward will anſwer the Work, and the profit of poſitive Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will anſwer all thy pains. I confeſs
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53132:181"/> Obedience to the affirmative part of the Command, (to pray, and hear, and give to the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, and in that manner which God commandeth,) is much harder than to the Negative; and to do good is much more difficult than not to do evil; but thy labour ſhall not be in vain. I have told thee already all the reward of a meer negative Holineſs, is a cooler Hell; but I muſt tell thee now, that the reward of poſitive Holineſs will be a glorious, and bleſſed, and endleſs ſtate of happineſs in Heaven. A nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Holineſs ſhall not have ſo much as a full negative Happineſs; it ſhall not <hi>aboliſh,</hi> only <hi>abate</hi> the Torments of Hell; and the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch Holineſs is counterfeit and hypocritical: But poſitive Holineſs ſhall have both, a full negative and poſitive Happineſs. God will do him good, that is good, and doth good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.4. And if God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to do good to a perſon, he will do it to good purpoſe. Mans doing good, which is his poſitive Holineſs, is little; yea, nothing to God. <hi>My good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs extendeth not to thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53132:182"/> Pſal.</hi> 16.3. But Gods doing good, which is his poſitive Bounty, is effectual, yea all in all with man; therefore when he would ſpeak in few words the great kindneſs he had in ſtore for his people, he only tells them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will not turn away from them to do them good.</hi> And verſ. 41. <hi>I will rejoyce over them to do them good.</hi> Nay, though negative godlineſs obtains only at preſent ſome reſpect from men, and hereafter fewer ſtripes from Hells Jaylor; poſitive Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath a far greater, and another manner of reward, both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>In the doing of thy Commands there is great reward,</hi> Pſal. 19. In the forbearing thy Prohibitions there is ſome reward, but in the doing thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands there is great reward. Poſitive Holineſs hath meat in its mouth, affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Obedience is its own recompence. It brings that calmneſs and ſerenity of mind, that nothing elſe can do. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Holineſs may do ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a negative quietneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from thoſe dreadful horrors and terrors which ſometimes ſeize thoſe who commit groſs unnatural ſins; but poſitive
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53132:182"/> Piety brings poſitive Peace. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119. 165. <hi>and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> They are not only freed from thoſe gripes of Conſcience with which many others are afflicted, but they have that ſpiritual joy and heart-comfort which the World is a ſtranger to, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. Faith which is not the leaſt part of this holineſs, fills the Soul with joy; yea, with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. I may appeal to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Chriſtian, whether ever he find more comfort, than when he hath done his God faithful Service, and whether ever their hearts are more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, than when they have been negligent of their Duty. <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were almoſt tranſported, their hearts leaped for joy that they had offered ſo willingly and liberally towards the building of the Temple; then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rejoyced, for that they offered wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, becauſe with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord; and <hi>David</hi> the King alſo rejoyced with great joy, and the wine of their joy was ſo ſtrong, that he was forced to give it
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53132:183"/> vent. <hi>Wherefore</hi> David <hi>bleſſed the Lord before all the Congregation, and ſaid, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be thou Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>our Father for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.9, 10, 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But mark, God is ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this man that mindeth his Duty, that he will ſuffer no wind, no ill wind to blow upon him. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> None muſt knock at their door, to diſturb them of their reſt. All the Creatures muſt be kind to them for his ſake; they muſt have nothing done to them which may be offenſive.</p>
               <p>Yet this is not all the profit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, (though I ſhall paſs to the next) much leſs in the other World. As I ſaid before, a poſitive Holineſs ſhall have a poſitive Heaven. The Chriſtians avoiding what is evil, through the blood of Chriſt, ſhall be recompenced with a freedom from Hell; and the Chriſtians doing what is good through the ſame meritorious cauſe, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with the fruition of Heaven. The two Servants that had (not hid their Talents in a Napkin, as the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtian doth, but) traded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53132:183"/> to his truſt, and improved his ſtock faithfully in doing good, as he had opportunity; is commended by his Maſter for a good and faithful Servant, and honoured with his Maſters own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> No leſs will content his large liberal heart than his own joy for his holy Ones, a joy ſo great that it cannot enter into them; their narrow Veſſels can never hold ſuch an Ocean, therefore they muſt enter into it, and be immerſt and ſwallow'd up as it were in this vaſt Sea of Pleaſure and Solace. But, <hi>Reader,</hi> conſider in this Chapter before the Text, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. What will be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this ſort of Piety, how infinitely the gains will exceed the pains, were they ten thouſand times more than they can be. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World; For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat,</hi> &amp;c. How doth every word ſpeak Love and Life, every ſyllable drop Myrh and Mercy. In which we may obſerve the welcome thoſe that are fruitful Chriſtians ſhall find from Chriſt in the other World.

               <p n="3">3. Its preparation for them from the Foundation of the World. When God firſt erected the ſtately Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, probably he made
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53132:185"/> the empirean Heaven the place of the bleſſed; for at firſt, when he laid the Foundations of the World, the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy; therefore it's likely the place of their Reſidence was made.

Come, where have ye been all this while? how could ye bear my abſence ſo long? what have ye done in a Valley of Tears, a Bochim, a place of weeping, ſo many years? When he calls them to die, his Voice need not be unpleaſant to them. He doth but call them as a Father his Child, out of the ſhower into his houſe. <hi>Come my people enter into the Chambers, ſhut the door, hide your ſelves for a very little moment, till the Indignation be overpaſt,</hi>

               <p n="13">13. COnſider, God takes moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in our poſitive Holineſs. It's true he is pleaſed to ſee men <hi>deny ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts;</hi> but nothing to that pleaſure which he takes in ſeeing them live <hi>righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly in this preſent evil World.</hi> He likes <hi>ceaſing from evil,</hi> becauſe it's agreeable to his Word; but he likes better <hi>doing of good,</hi> becauſe it's more conformable to his Will, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53132:187"/> worketh righteouſneſs.</hi> Thou meeteſt him with the riches of Mercy, who worketh what is good with alacrity. If he come to thee, thou wilt not caſt him away; nay, thou wilt run to meet him, and embrace him. As the Father of the Prodigal ran to meet his returning Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. And as one at odds, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be reconciled, tells us, He will meet his Oppoſite half-way. And I may ſay of Gods meeting a Soul that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Righteouſneſs, as God tells <hi>Moſes; Behold,</hi> Aaron <hi>thy Brother comes to meet thee, and when he ſeeth thee, he will be glad at his heart.</hi> Behold, thy God and Father cometh to meet thee, and when he ſeeth thee, working Righteouſneſs, he will be glad at his heart; nay, ſo glad, that the diſadvantage of a mans Country ſhall not hinder him of this kindneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive now that God is no Reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but in every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him.</hi> God proclaimeth to all the World, That he delighteth in ſuch a mans way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23. and therefore his Word which he hath given us for our
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53132:187"/> Rule herein, is called <hi>his good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Will,</hi> Rom. 12.2. And the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch perſons are moſt like God, therefore they have moſt of his love and delight. God is a pure Act, and ſo cannot but approve of them that are active. He is ever at work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Hitherto my Father worketh, and I work.</hi> And its righteouſneſs he is always working, <hi>The Lord is holy in all his Ways, and righteous in all his Works,</hi> Pſal. 145. He is good, and doth good; ſo that thoſe who are poſitively holy, do moſt reſemble him, and ſo do moſt delight him. We all take moſt pleaſure in thoſe Children that are our exacteſt Pictures. <hi>Reader,</hi> art thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively holy; Canſt thou ſay, I am no Drunkard, no Glutton, no Adulterer? thou mayſt ſay this, and be like the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, for the Devil himſelf may ſay as much. Canſt thou ſay, I am no Thief, no Swearer, no Blaſphemer, no Sabbath-breaker, no Trader with falſe Weights or falſe Meaſures, no Bearer of falſe witneſs againſt my Neighbour? A Beaſt may ſay as much, and thou mayſt be free from theſe ſins, and yet like a
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53132:188"/> Beaſt. But if thou liveſt in the love and delight of the bleſſed Majeſty, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pleaſure, this is to be like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. And doing good to others, this is to be like God, and this is that which takes his heart. Common huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is much affected with one that aboundeth in goodneſs, and is rich in good Works; therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That for a good man poſſibly ſome may even dare to die,</hi> Rom. 5. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is, becauſe the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were divided into three ſorts of Perſons; there were <hi>Reſhagnim,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the wicked or ungodly, thoſe who lived without the Worſhip of God, and walked in prophane courſes; there were alſo <hi>Tſidikim,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the juſt or righteous, men of rigid righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſevere innocency; and <hi>Chaſidim,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the good and liberal, men of large Hearts and open Hands, to do good to others; who as publick Conduits, are of publick advantage in the places where they live. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Scarcely for a righteous man;</hi> that is, for a man of auſtere Juſtice will one die; but for a good man, a man full of good
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53132:188"/> works, one that is bountiful to others, and uſeful in his Generation, <hi>a man would even dare to die.</hi> Humanity is ſo taken with doing good, that a man can be contented almoſt to die for ſuch; much more muſt goodneſs it ſelf, and the Fountain of all Goodneſs be affected therewith. He tells us, <hi>That he is a God who executeth Kindneſs, Judgment, and Righteouſneſs: For in theſe things I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Both in doing them my ſelf, and ſeeing them done by others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. Mich.</hi> 6.8.</p>
               <p>What thinkeſt thou, <hi>Reader,</hi> of this motive to good Works, wouldſt thou not delight the heart of God? How long haſt thou by thy Omiſſions grieved him, and is it not yet time to rejoyce him? How often haſt thou diſpleaſed him? how many millions of times? and wilt thou not now pleaſe him? Thou daily ſeeſt, that though he hath no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to his Creatures (but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) <hi>he doth them good, and gives them food and fruitful ſeaſons, and fills their Hearts with gladneſs.</hi> And wilt thou not do thy utmoſt to glad his Heart, who hath above all apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53132:189"/> obliged thee? Truly, he doth not deſerve the name of a rational Creature, who doth not above all things ſeek to pleaſe his Maker; and there is no way hereunto like abounding in well-doing. Therefore the Apoſtle begs for the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, That they may be filled with the knowledge of his Will.</hi> Why? that they might keep their Light in a dark Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, or have it as men wear a Glaſs-eye, for ſhew, and not for uſe; or that men might be able to talk the more of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the things that appertain thereunto? No, <hi>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleaſing,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to his whole liking and delight, that ye might pleaſe God. I, but how may this be done, he preſently tells us how, <hi>That ye may walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleaſing, being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every good work.</hi> There is no ſuch way to pleaſe God, as fruitfulneſs in every good Work. It rejoyceth the Huſbandman to ſee his Trees laden with fruit, to ſee his Fields cover'd over (as the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> phraſe is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. <hi>ult.</hi>) with Corn, and to ſee his returns anſwer his Coſt. And it rejoyceth the bleſſed
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53132:189"/> God, to ſee an Heart that hath long lain fallow, and been barren, full of faith, and love, and humility, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs, and all the fruits of Righteouſneſs; and ſo a Life that hath been idle and unprofitable, abundant in acts of Piety, Charity, and the like. <hi>David,</hi> who ſerved the Wills of God in his Generation, he of all men was the man after Gods own heart.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Conſider, thou haſt but a little time to do good in, therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thee to ſet ſpeedily upon it, and to be diligent at it. Alas, how ſhort is thy whole Life, from the Womb to the Tomb; <hi>It's but a ſhadow that fleeth away, and continueth not; a Vapour that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth for a little time, and then vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away,</hi> it's nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 14.2. <hi>James</hi> 4.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.6. And how much of this time is gone, hath been ſpent as a tale that is told, impertinently, and to no purpoſe, in doing nothing, or in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is worſe than nothing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.9. How ſhort that time is that remaineth God only knoweth; for thy time is in his hand, not thine own; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it behoveth thee to redeem the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53132:190"/> time, to make the moſt of it, and whilſt thou haſt it, to improve it for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good, O Friend, haſt thou loyter'd ſo long; is thy work ſo great, thy day to work in ſo ſhort; and yet is it not time to beſtir thy ſelf? Is death at thy door? art thou within a ſtep of eternity, within the view of the other World, and yet wilt thou not up and be doing? Can any aſſure thee of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Vineyard another year; nay, another moneth; nay, another day; and is it not yet time to be fruitful? Doſt thou not ſee that as Labourers are ſent into the Vineyard at all hours, ſo they go out of the Vineyard at all hours. Thou oweſt a debt to Nature, to the God of Nature; the day of payment is not expreſſed, therefore it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at any time. <hi>Reader,</hi> though ſome fruit falls from the Tree by reaſon of its maturity; yet how much more is blown off, or cudgeld off, whilſt it is green? Do not thine eyes ſee Coffins and Graves of all ſorts and ſizes? And wilt thou be as the ſilly Beaſts, who though the Butcher come one day to the Field and fetch away one, another day
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53132:190"/> and fetch away another to the ſlaughter; yet thoſe that remain neither miſs them that are gone, nor dread their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies. O Friend, what doſt thou think to do, when time is gone, and death comes? wilt thou ſtop the Sun of thy Life in its career? Will it hear thy Voice, and obey thy Command? Or wilt thou call to Time, as <hi>Iſraels</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral did to the Sun; <hi>Stand ſtill,</hi> that I may be avenged of all my Senſuality, and Idleneſs, and Pride, and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and all my ſpiritual Enemies, which have robbed me of God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Do you imagine Time will be at your beck? Or are the apprehenſions of the King of Terrors, and of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Day of Judgment, and of an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Eternity, no whit rouſing or awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to thee?</p>
               <p>Canſt thou believe a dark night of Death a fit time to trim, and adorn, and attrire thy Soul in, for the love and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Now God gives thee a day, but of how many hours, whether longer or ſhorter, thou canſt not tell. Thy life is fleeing away, Time's Chariot
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53132:191"/> moves ſwiftly: <hi>Yet a little while the Light is with thee, walk while thou haſt the Light, leſt Darkneſs come upon thee,</hi> Joh. 12.35. Two things eſpecially occur in theſe words, 1. Now thou haſt time, yea opportunity, make much of it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to the utmoſt; <hi>Walk while thou haſt the Light.</hi> God allots thee a due time for bringing forth: Hence it's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, That God gave the Figg-Tree three years to bear in; other Trees, as the Olive and Nut-Tree required more time, but ſo ſucculent a Plant as the Figg-Tree needed no more; nay, ſaith <hi>A Lapide, If the Figg-Tree bear not the third year, it will never bear.</hi> God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expected Brick without allowing Straw, nor requires his Rent before Quarter-day, or the time of payment comes. 2. Thy time, or at leaſt thine opportunity is very ſhort; therefore work much in a little time, whilſt thou haſt the Light; <hi>Yet a little while the Light is with thee, a little while and the Light will be taken from thee.</hi> A little while, and the light of Life; a little while, and the light of means, and helps, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Grace will be taken from thee.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53132:191"/> And what then? truly, then darkneſs will come upon thee, (a dark Grave will be the receptacle of thy Body, and a dark Dungeon will be the receptacle of thy Soul, if thou now loytereſt,) and darkneſs is no fit ſtate, nor a dark night a fit time to walk or work in.</p>
               <p>Darkneſs is dreadful, and every thing ſeems more frightful in the night. If a mans houſe be on fire in the night, that he hears the noiſe and ratling of the flames, ſeeth no way of eſcape for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Wife, and his Children; O in what a plight is he? he ſtands naked in his Chamber, at a loſs what to do, he is full of horrors and terrors, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by none but himſelf. How pale is his Countenance, and how heavy his Heart, when he ſeeth the flames ſeizing his Chamber, when they come near his Body; he is almoſt drown'd to death with grief and ſorrow before he is burnt to death with the flames. So it is, when the night of death ſurpriſeth the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, that hath neglected the doing of good, when Conſcience is in a flame about his ears, and frights him with the fore-apprehenſions of the unquenchable
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53132:192"/> burnings, and with cutting reflections upon his former negligence and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs; the man is quaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, not knowing what to do: Is that a time to put on the Armor of Light, when he is putting off his natural Life? Is a dark night of fear and amazement a time to ſeek God in, or to work out his own Salvation? Ah Friend, it is too great and weighty a work to be done in an inſtant, and the poor Sinner is too much aſtoniſhed to ſet about it. If the fear of a danger gone, and over, kill a <hi>Nabal,</hi> and make his heart like a ſtone; what will the fear, the certain knowledge of wrath, of the wrath of a God, of the everlaſting wrath of a God to come, do to a poor Sinner? O Friend, make uſe of time while thou haſt it. <hi>Work the work of him that ſent thee while it is day, for the night cometh when no man can work,</hi> Joh. 9.4.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLI.</hi> The grand cauſe of ſins of Omiſſion. An unregenerate heart, with the cure of it; a renewed nature.</head>
               <p>I Proceed now to the ſecond and third particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> The cauſe and cure of ſins of Omiſſion; I ſhall recite one more general and principal Cauſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more ſpecial, and leſs principal, and joyn the Cure to the Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The grand Cauſe of theſe ſins of Omiſſion, is an unregenerate Heart. Where the ground is unplowed, and lieth fallow, no Fruit can be expected; Weeds may grow, good Corn cannot grow there: When the Heart is not broken up by Repentance, but hardned through cuſtom and continuance in ſin, no fruits of Righteouſneſs, no Faith, no Love, or Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected there. <hi>Can the Leopard change his ſpots, or the Blackamore his skin? no more can he that is accuſtomed to do evil, learn to do well,</hi> Jer. 23.13. Natures Fruit will be according to its Root,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53132:193"/> whether ſweet or ſowr. There muſt of neceſſity be a good Foundation laid, before there can be a good Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of Holineſs rear'd. An unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Heart hath no tendency towards it, and Nature will work little farther than its own inclination. The Water will run as the Tyde carrieth it. Nay, the unregenerate Heart is contrary to religious Duties, hath an hatred and abhorrency of them, no wonder then if it live in the Omiſſion of them. The Carnal Mind, Lady Reaſon her ſelf, the chief and principal faculty of man, is enmity againſt God, <hi>It is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. He who is an enemy to a mans Perſon, will never be a friend to his Precepts; much leſs will he who is enmity againſt Gods Life, be ſubject to his Law. There is an impoſſibility here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Neither indeed can be.</hi> Till the Heart be changed, it will never like the Divine Commands, that are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its luſts; and till it be brought to love them, it will neglect Obedience to them. When the Will, the great Commander, is ſet againſt the Laws of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53132:193"/> God, how can any of the other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſubmit to them? As in fleſhly luſts, the titillation is from ſenſe and appetite; but the conſent of the reaſonable Will, is, that which makes it a vice; ſo unto good, the inclination may poſſibly be from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or education, but the royal aſſent of the Will is that which makes it a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The Devil finds it no hard work to part Sin and his Duty, whoſe Will never choſe it, and whoſe Heart never loved it; but it will be much eaſier to part him and his Duty, whoſe Will and Heart have an enmity and reluctancy againſt it. If a Lads calling doth not ſuit his <hi>genius,</hi> he ſeldom comes to do any thing well, or to be expert at it; much leſs when he hates it. The Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar who loves not his Book, will hardly proceed from the degree of a Dunce; much leſs he who loatheth his Book. If the nature of a man be contrary to God, and his Ways, the preſence of God is troubleſome to him, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. <hi>They ſay to God, depart from us;</hi> and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God is tedious to them. <hi>When will the new Moon be gone, and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath be over.</hi> And the Precepts of God
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53132:194"/> are Fetters and Cords to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let us break their bonds aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> Common gifts of the Spirit, as Illumination, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, ſudden flaſhes of Affection may do ſomewhat againſt this diſtemper of Nature, but the virtue of that Phyſick is ſoon ſpent, and then it returns to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer illneſs. Colours not laid in Oyl, will ſoon be waſht off.</p>
               <p>Indeed, how can it be expected, that a Body ſeparated from a Soul ſhould ſtir or move; and much leſs can it be expected, that a Soul without Chriſt, its life, ſhould pray, or hear, or watch, or do any thing according to the Will of God. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>I live,</hi> i. e. <hi>to God, according to his Will, doing what is good:</hi> But how comes this about, at whoſe coſt doth he keep houſe; <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> I may thank my Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, I am beholden unto him for all abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity unto ſacred actions: <hi>And the life that I live in the Fleſh, is by Faith in the Son of God.</hi> It's from Chriſt alone that I receive ſupplies of ſtrength and virtue to live to God. What will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Unregenerate perſon, who
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53132:194"/> is without Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>He who hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi> And he who hath not life, I am ſure cannot live to God. The Apoſtle fitly joyns them together, Trees without fruit, twice dead, <hi>i. e.</hi> certainly dead, or dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 12. Where the ſtock is dead, the branches muſt needs wither; and if they wither, there is little likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of fruit.</p>
               <p>Beſides, an unregenerate Soul is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated (as to internal Omiſſions, in regard of his want of ſpiritual life, ſo) to external Omiſſions, in regard of his engagements to his carnal intereſt. One is poſſibly married to Profit, and when that calls him, he muſt go, though Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet or Family, or any other Duties bid him ſtay, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>No man can ſerve God and Mammon, but he will love the one, and hate the other; or diſpiſe the one, and cleave to the other.</hi> When once there comes a competition between godlineſs and gain in the life, it will quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear which hath the greateſt ſway and predominancy in the heart. The young man would not follow Chriſt, becauſe his Eſtate denied to give him leave.
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53132:195"/> Had he been leſs rich, he had been (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) more religious; but having once eſpouſed the intereſt of his Wealth, he could not leave it, though he left God, and Chriſt, and Heaven for it. Another is ingaged to Pleaſures, and when they require his preſence, it cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he will deny them for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes if Religion, which are ſo painful to him. <hi>Herod</hi> may pretend fair for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and profeſs ſome kindneſs to the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> but when his <hi>Dalilah</hi> commands, his love to her over-comes his fear of <hi>John;</hi> and inſtead of doing many things, or any thing that was good, he cuts off that Head which had a Tongue in it ſo bold, as to reprove him for his ſin. A third is wedded to Honour, and if that be inconſiſtent with Holineſs; as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the caſe may be, he will neglect his Duty to God, to pay his Homage to this <hi>Diana. Jehu</hi> will do one good work, becauſe Gods and his intereſt were both conjoyned. His ſlaughter of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Sons and Prophets tended to ſettle him the firmer in his Throne, and ſo his ambition call'd for the ſame with Gods Command. But <hi>Jehu</hi> will omit
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53132:195"/> another good work, he will not deſtroy the Idolatry at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> becauſe there his intereſt and Gods were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for though God enjoyned the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Idols in one place as well as another, yet <hi>Jehu</hi> was fearful as his Predeceſſor <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that the Crown would not be faſt on his Head, if the people ſhould have gone up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to Worſhip; therefore when his carnal intereſt forbids what God commands, he diſobeys God, to ſerve that. There is no unſanctified perſon in the World, but hath ſome worldly intereſt of his own ſuperiour and paramount; nay, in many things oppoſite and contrary to the intereſt of God; and therefore though he may obey God, while both thoſe Intereſts can agree and walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame way, yet when there is a neceſſity of their parting, he will cleave to that which hath the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy within him. Where God hath ſome reſidence, and is entertain'd but as an underling to the Fleſh, when it comes to this paſs, that one muſt be turn'd out of doors (for they cannot agree long together) you may eaſily gueſs which it ſhall be.</p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:53132:196"/>
               <p>The Cure of this, <hi>Reader,</hi> muſt be (if thou art not born again) to get a new heart. An old heart will never ſerve for, or enable unto the acts of new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The water will riſe no higher than the Fountain head a whence it flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. If you would have a Clock to move regularly, and the hand without to go true, you muſt have the wheels and poizes right within. A good temperament of Body may cauſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to ſome things that are honeſt; but that excellency muſt be of little worth, that hath its Original from mans baſeſt part, (as thoſe materials are me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

An exact Conſtitution may help a man to be mild, meek, courteous, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, ſhame-faced; but theſe cannot be adopted into the Family of goodneſs, becauſe here, as they ſay, in the motion of the Serpent, the tayl leads the way to the Head; the Body rules and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Soul, and the mans perfection is from his meaneſt and worſt part. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53132:196"/> the cauſe of all this ſeeming-virtue is mutable and mortal. Age, or Sickneſs, or change of Air, or of Condition, may alter a mans good nature; and then where is his Religion? Truly, as a Comet, it came without giving notice, and goeth away without giving warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Cauſe being taken away, the Effect ceaſeth.</p>
               <p>Improved Reaſon will do more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Religion, than a ſound bodily Conſtitution; but yet the Moraliſts, for all their Reaſon, were far enough from being religious. Indeed, reaſon right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved, is a ſpecial help, a ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hand-Maid to Religion; but as they uſed it, or rather abuſed it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an Oppoſite and Enemy to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Mind or Underſtanding, which is the ſupream faculty of the Soul, they ſet up in defiance of Revelations, and with it they out-face Illumination. <gap reason="foreign">

It hath its high thoughts, and carnal reaſonings, and vain imaginations, in which ſtrong holds, Luſt ſhelters it ſelf againſt all the Convictions of our own Spirit. And as the Moraliſt deifieth his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in oppoſition to Faith, ſo he ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeth the liberty of his Will in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſpecial Energy and Virtue of the Holy Ghoſt. Liberty, ſaith the Philoſopher, I have by Nature; that is, a freedom to chooſe Good or Evil, I have in common with the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but goodneſs to that liberty, or an application of it to the choice of good rather than evil; this I have from my ſelf, my Reaſon, and I am beholden to my ſelf for it. So that, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, if this be true, <hi>Si nobis poteſt libera vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas ex deo eſt, quoad hoc poteſt eſſe, vel bona, vel mala, bona vero voluntas ex nobis est; melius eſt id quod a nobis quam quod ab illo eſt,</hi> De peccat. merit. lib. 2.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53132:197"/> cap. 18. If our Will be free from God, it may be good or bad; but if it be good from our ſelves, better is that which we have from our ſelves, than that which we have from God. In ſhort, this moral Votary differs from the natural, that the Original of the latters Religion, is the Conſtitution of his Body, of the formers is the chief faculty of his Soul; but neither of theſe can make a man religious, for where the Vitals are tainted, and the inward parts infected, it's in vain to uſe Plaiſters or outward Medicines. Indeed, here is the great fault of both the former, that they take no notice of the depravation of mans nature, which alone would convince them of the neceſſity of a change. They who have crazed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and crackt Brains, cannot ſee any defects in themſelves, being prepoſſeſt with an Opinion of their own perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Both the Naturaliſts and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts are ſo far from knowing the plague of their own hearts, that they count every thing of Nature rather lovely than loathſome. And as among the <hi>Moors,</hi> blackneſs is counted a beauty,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53132:198"/> becauſe it's common and general, and they ſee no other. So with theſe men, the vitioſity of Nature, which is the ſeed of all evil, is commended for the ſpring of Virtue. Indeed, they are in love with their Diſeaſe, and inſtead of Health, have this unhappineſs, that they feel not their own ſickneſs; ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other can be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or perform thoſe Duties which God requireth.</p>
               <p>Regeneration is abſolutely requiſite to this; He that layeth not that for his Foundation, can never build a Temple for God, he muſt needs prove a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; that is, worſe than naught when he begun. Some tell us, that Trees ſhoot above ground as much and no more than they do under ground. I am ſure there is no more godlineſs outwardly in the Life, than there is inwardly in the Heart. If the fear and love of God be the great ſpring to ſet all the wheels a going in the ways of Religion, then all is right, but till then nothing is right. If there be not the Oyl of ſolid Grace in the Veſſel of the Heart, to feed Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Lamp and Holineſs in the Life, both will quickly ſail.</p>

               <p>When God intends that his people ſhould <hi>walk in his Statutes, keep his Judgments, and do them;</hi> what doth he for them to prepare them and enable them thereunto? truly this, he rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates them, and changeth them, and putteth a new principle into them: <hi>I will give them a new Heart, and a new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. I will caſt them in the fire of my Word, and though they are old, tough untoward metal, I will melt them, and ſoften them, and they ſhall run into my mould. But how can this be?

The

               <p>Two things, <hi>Reader,</hi> I would ſpecially commend to thee, without which thou canſt never rightly obey any poſitive Precept; and they are to make ſure of a change in thy Judgment and thy Heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Make ſure of a change in thy Judgment concerning Sin and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. By nature thou haſt lookt on Sin, as <hi>Achan</hi> on the Wedge of Gold, and <hi>David</hi> on <hi>Bathſheba</hi> as lovely and deſirable; thou haſt beheld it through the Devils Spectacles, and ſo haſt judged it elegible, if ſtill thou art of the ſame mind; though thou mayſt for ſhame or fear forbear it a while, yet as two Lovers parted by their Parents contrive and conſpire how to meet together, and do find ſome opportunity or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with their deſires; ſo thou wilt find ſome time to give thy old beloved
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53132:199"/> Luſts a viſit, and as cloſe and fond em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces as ever. There is a neceſſity of being renewed in the Spirit of thy Mind, if thou wouldſt not be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the World in ſin and folly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. Formerly thou haſt lookt on Holineſs as a mean contemptible thing, as a fooliſh ridiculous thing, as a fruitleſs unprofitable thing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.48, 49. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. and thereupon haſt turn'd thy back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: If thou art ſtill of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thou will be ſtill of thine old un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Converſation. Till thy Mind be enlightned to ſee the beauty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the excellency of Obedience, the equity of the Divine Precepts, the Right and Title that God hath to thy Perſon and Service, thou wilt never perform Duties to any purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Till thou art turn'd from Darkneſs to Light, thou canſt never be turned from Satan to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>They must be renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that created them, who would put on the new man, which is after God, is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:53132:200"/> Col. 3.10. Epheſ. 4.24. This illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is requiſite in order to the ſecond thing; there muſt be a change in the Judgment, before there can be any in Affections.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Get thy Heart changed about Sin and Obedience: If there be not a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thee of Sin, and a love in thee to Holineſs, thou wilt not much or long forſake the one, or follow after the other. By nature thou loveſt Sin as thy Meat and Drink, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.17. as thy Dainties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. as thy Members, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. as thy right Hand and right Eye, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. as thy ſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. Now whilſt this love continueth, thou canſt never leave ſin. As the Dog may forbear the meat on the Table whilſt the Servants eye is on him, for fear of the Cudgel. But when he can come at it alone and ſcape, he will fall to it greedily. If from a Conviction of the great evil of Sin, thy Heart be not brought to abhor it; though ſome qualm of Conſcience, or ſharp Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may make thee deſiſt from it at preſent; yet when theſe Diſtempers (as thou counteſt them) are gone,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53132:200"/> thy Stomach will come; and as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of an Ague, thou wilt fall too more greedily, and feed on it more largely than ever. By Nature thy heart is ſet againſt Obedience. Thy Voice is, <hi>I will not have this man to Rule over me.</hi> The Voice of thy Heart, which was the Voice of their Lips; for they ſpoke plain <hi>Engliſh. As for the word that thou haſt ſpoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not do it,</hi> Jer. 44.16. Both the King and his Laws are odious to thee, and how then ſhall they be obey'd? If thy Heart continue thus bent againſt Holineſs, doſt thou think thou canſt mind it? All thy ſhews, and ſhadows, and flouriſhes, and profeſſion, and privilegdes, and purpoſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, will ſignifie nothing for Holineſs, or againſt Sin; till thou canſt ſay with <hi>David, I hate every falſe way: but thy Law do I love,</hi> Pſal. 119. He is hardly ſeparated from his Maſter, be he God or Satan who is bound and faſtened to him with the heart-ſtrings of love. And the Devil ſhall find it a tough taſk to rob Chriſt of that Servant, who takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight in his work. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53132:201"/> 
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> thy judgment muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, that thou mayſt judge of Sin and Holineſs aright, and thereby thy heart be brought out of love with Sin, and in love with Holineſs; and then the work of Piety will go on pleaſantly, and thou wilt chearfully obey the Divine Commands. His Statutes will be thy Songs, whilſt thou art in this houſe of thy Pilgrimage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. O how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily wilt thou ſet about thy buſineſs, when the Laws of God are the joy of thy heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.111. And thy delight is in his Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. when thou haſt a nature in thee that inclines, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth, and ingageth thee to godlineſs, when thou canſt ſavour and reliſh Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Ordinances, and taſt them more pleaſant to thy Soul, than ever the greateſt Dainties have been to thy Body.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldſt be truly and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively holy, thou ſeeſt, <hi>Reader,</hi> a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Converſion; without it thou canſt no more act holily, than a dead man can move, or a ſtone walk, or the Tyde of it ſelf turn backward, when in its full ſtrength and career. What
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53132:201"/> then wilt thou do? For I muſt confeſs withall, that this regenerating Work, which is a reſurrection from the Dead, and a new Creation, is altogether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thy power. Thou canſt as ſoon ſtop the Sun in its courſe, and Seal up the influence of the Stars, as convert thy ſelf. But to encourage thee, know that there is help to be had; God hath proclaimed himſelf the Author of it; <hi>James</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us,</hi> (and his Word and Miniſters the Inſtruments of it) <hi>by the word of Truth.</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. So that thy work muſt be to wait on God in his Word, and to beg hard of him, that he would be found of thee in his own way. Alas, how ſhouldſt thou fill Heaven and Earth night and day with thy Cries, and Groans, and Tears, and Prayers; when thou conſidereſt, except thou liveſt to God, and walkeſt after the Spirit, thou art loſt for ever; and without a new Heart and new Spirit thou canſt not live or walk ſo, and none but God can do this for thee. O Friend, fall down on thy knees before him, acknowledge thy unworthineſs;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53132:202"/> urge God with his Promiſe, <hi>I will give you a new heart, and a new Spirit will I put into you; and I will take away your hearts of ſtone, and give unto you hearts of Fleſh. And I will put my Spirit into you, and cauſe you to walk in my ways,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.26, 27. God cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his own hand-writing, he will make good what he hath ſpoken. Look up to Jeſus Chriſt to plead for thee, who died to purchaſe Holineſs, and delights to ſee that paid which he hath bought; and hath God engaged to him, <hi>That he ſhall ſee the travail of his Soul, to his ſatisfaction,</hi> Iſa. 53.10. and perſevere in ſo doing, knowing thou ſhalt reap in time, if thou fainteſt not.</p>

Whatever the World talks of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and goodneſs, notwithſtanding their ignorance, <hi>Without knowledge the mind is not good,</hi> Prov. 19.2. They preſume to excuſe their dark Heads with their good Hearts, but theſe two are inconſiſtent. A dark Cellar is not fuller of Vermine, nor a dark hole of duſt, than a dark Heart is of filthineſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1, 2. They who want the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, are under the dominion of the Devil. He is the Ruler of the darkneſs of this World, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. And I am ſure the unclean Spirit never bears ſway in a clean Heart, nor this evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in a good Heart. No, as the Eagle, he firſt pecks out the eyes of his prey, and then devours it. How eaſily is a
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53132:203"/> blind Soul conquer'd and kill'd by the enemies of his Salvation? What Error will not an ignorant Creature ſwallow down? he is like water, ready to take the impreſſion and form of what Veſſel you pleaſe to pour him into, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. Our Saviour tells the <hi>Sadduces, That they erred, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> And the Apoſtles told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who doubted at leaſt about the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, (as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> denied it) <hi>Some have not the knowledge of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.32. What crime will not an ignorant man commit? Knowledge to the Mind is as Light to the World, which diſcovers our way, and thereby prevents our wandrings; but it's no wonder at all for men in the night, and darkneſs of ignorance, to go aſtray, or to ſtumble and fall. <hi>If a man walk in the night, he ſtumbleth, becauſe he ſeeth not the light of this World,</hi> Joh. 11.9. Why do we think Sin is called <hi>a work of darkneſs,</hi> truly, not only becauſe it's from the Devil, the Prince of Darkneſs; and he that doth evil loveth darkneſs, hates the light, and it's the way to blackneſs of darkneſs; but alſo becauſe it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53132:203"/> in the Womb of a dark Heart: The Prince of Darkneſs may beget what Monſters he pleaſeth on ſuch Perſons, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Ignorant women were laden with divers luſts.</hi> No ſoil fuller of ſuch weeds, than that which is not manured with knowledge. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ignorance was the ground of his waſting the Church at ſuch a cruel rate. <hi>I was a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, injurious, but I did it ignorantly,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. That Monſter Sin, which the Sun hid his head as aſhamed to behold the Murther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, had ignorance for its Mother: <hi>Acts</hi> 3.15. <hi>Ye killed the Prince of Life,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>And now Brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did alſo your Rulers.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Had they known, they would not have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Now if igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be the cauſe of ſuch grieveous Commiſſions, it muſt much more be the cauſe of Omiſſion; for in all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions there are great Omiſſions: but I ſhall ſhew particularly that Ignorance is one cauſe of ſins of Omiſſion.</p>
               <p>We are bound to love God, and that <hi>with all our Hearts, and with all our Souls,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53132:204"/> and with all our Strength,</hi> Matth. 22.37. But is it poſſible to love one whom we are ignorant of? Did ever any fear an unknown Evil, or deſire or delight in an unknown Good? Are not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rarities, and richeſt Jewels of the World, that are undiſcovered, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> 1 Joh. 3. I am ſure he that doth not ſo much as ſee God with the eye of his Soul, his Underſtanding can never love him. We ſay, <hi>What the eye ſees not, the heart grieves not;</hi> it's as true, what the eye ſeeth not, the heart loves not.</p>
               <p>Who can obey Divine Precepts, who is ignorant of them? or fear Divine Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, who doth not know them? or be allured by Divine Promiſes, who is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a ſtranger to them? God, and Chriſt, and Pardon, and Life, and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; Covenant, may ſtand long enough knocking at the door of an Heart faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Ignorance, before they will find admittance. It is our Duty, our great Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Duty, to believe in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>This is his Commandment, that ye believe in him
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53132:204"/> whom he hath ſent,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. But igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hinders this, <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard,</hi> Rom. 10.10. Who will truſt a meer ſtranger, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a matter of weight? I had need to know him well whom I truſt with my Soul and Salvation, with all I am worth for this and the other World. A wiſe man will not venture his Eſtate, much leſs his Life, leaſt of all his Soul with one of whoſe integrity, and faithfulneſs, and ability, and reſponſibleneſs he hath not good aſſurance. The <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> ſaying is, <hi>They that know thy Name, will truſt in thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. They who know thy Grace &amp; Goodneſs, thy Promiſe, and Power, and Truth, they will truſt thee, but others will not. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hope could not have been ſo high, nor the Wine of his joy ſo briſk, when his Death drew near, had it not been for his great acquaintance with him with, whom he had ventured his all; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed,</hi> (how willing, how ready, how able to ſave me,) <hi>and what I have committed to him, he is able to keep for me againſt that day.</hi> Knowledg is ſo requiſite to Faith, that it's once &amp; again put for Faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10.

               <p>Again, Our Duty is to repent even pain of eternal perdition, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.22, 23. But ignorance cauſeth men to omit this as well as the other. Where there is a vail upon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there is ever a caul upon the Heart and Conſcience. As in the night ſeaſon, we have always the hardeſt Froſts and the coldeſt weather. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghoſt tells us, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall repent and turn to the Lord, <hi>The vail ſhall be taken away,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.16, 17. While the vail remains, they are ſtill turning more and more from God, till wrath come upon them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; but when the Vail ſhall be taken away, that they ſhall ſee the evil, and miſchief, and loathſomeneſs, and folly of thoſe ways they have turned to; and alſo for the beauty, and amiableneſs, and bounty, and kindneſs of that God they have turned from, then they will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return unto the Lord. Indeed, men may thank their Ignorance for moſt of their Omiſſions, eſpecially the Heathen, and many Chriſtians who live in dark
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53132:205"/> corners of the Land. I, and many who are as void and empty of Knowledge, as the Heathen who live under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Many of theſe neglect Family-Duties, Cloſet-Prayer, a ſtrict Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Lords-Day, edifying others to their power as opportunity is offer'd them, and ſeveral others, becauſe they do not underſtand them to be their Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> the cure of this muſt be for thee, if ignorant, to labour after the Knowledge of God, and thy Duty to him. When <hi>David</hi> leaves his charge with his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> to ſerve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the bleſſed God, as the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his life; Mark how he begins with the means thereof, and concludes with the motive thereto. <hi>And thou</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>my Son, know the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and willing mind: If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever,</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Solomon,</hi> thou Son of my Love, thou Son of my Vows, I am now dying, and going to my long home; Nature and Grace, my love to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53132:206"/> thee, and to God, do both ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline me to deſire thy well-fare, and to wiſh thee well eternally; I know not better how to ſpeak and declare it, than by charging and commanding thee, that what-ever thou omitteſt or neglecteſt, thou wouldſt adore and worſhip the God of thy Fathers, and that not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and cuſtomarily, but ſolemnly and ſincerely, with a perfect Heart and willing Mind; and to this end there is a neceſſity of thy knowing him. Till thou knoweſt his Grace and Goodneſs, thou wilt never love him; till thou knoweſt his Holineſs and Juſtice, thou wilt never fear him; till thou knoweſt his Promiſes, and Power, and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thou wilt never truſt him; and till thou knoweſt his boundleſs Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dominion over, his unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Right and Propriety in the works of his Hands, thou wilt never obey him; therefore ſtudy the knowledge of this God of thy Fathers, that thou mayſt ſerve him; for be aſſured, he will not be mocked: <hi>But with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, he will carry himſelf upright; and with the Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he will carry himſelf froward,</hi>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:53132:206"/> Pſal. 18. <hi>If thou liveſt after the Fleſh, thou ſhalt die; if thou walkeſt after the Spirit, thou ſhalt live.</hi> If thou ſeek him in his own way, with all thy Heart, as the great work and buſineſs of thy Life, he will reveal himſelf to thee, and be found of thee in a way of Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but if thou imbrace the World, or the Fleſh, as thy Soveraigns or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo caſt him off; be confident he will forſake and caſt thee off for ever, and then what will Devils do to thee, and what miſery will not ſurprize thee? Friend, God affords thee many helps for knowledge, and wilt thou not labour after it? ſhall men ſtumble, and fall into Hell, for want of doing their Duties; and neglect to do their Duties for want of knowledge, and that in the clear Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel, as thoſe do that live in the night and darkneſs of Heatheniſm and Paganiſm? <hi>Reader,</hi> wilt thou not ſee at Mid-day, at Noon-day? ſhall neither the Works nor Word of God teach thee the knowledge of him? Wouldſt thou do the Will of God or not? if thou wouldſt not, I have no more to ſay to thee, <hi>But the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53132:207"/> Lord have mercy on thee.</hi> If thou wouldſt, as thou muſt, if ever thou be ſaved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. Thou ſeeſt a neceſſity of knowledge, for can thy Child or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant do thy Will, if they be ignorant of thy Will. Is it rational to expect, that one who knoweth not what thou wouldſt have, ſhould do what thou wouldſt have? Why canſt not thou make thy Beaſt as pliable, and as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to thee as thy Son? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy Beaſt is not ſo capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding thy mind as thy Son is? Nay, if thou ſhouldſt do what God commands, and not know that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, thou couldſt not obey him in it; for all Obedience conſiſteth in doing what God bids us, becauſe he bids us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5, 6.

                  <hi>CHAP. XLIII.</hi> Another cauſe of ſins of Omiſsion, Idleneſs, with the cure of it.</head>
               <p n="3">3. A Third cauſe of ſins of Omiſſion, is Idleneſs. Negative Holineſs requires no great pains; a man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Drunkenneſs, ſwearing, lying, ſtealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any great labour. A man may keep his Bed, or his Chair all day, and ſo do no hurt. Some men, as the Hiſtorian obſerves,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> are <hi>ſola ſocor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia innocentes,</hi> do no miſchief (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they dare not, God having forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it, but) becauſe it would coſt them ſome pains to do it. Their Heads muſt work to plot and contrive it, and their Hands to manage and execute it. There is a ſluggiſh temper and poorneſs of ſpirit in many men, who prefer a mean quiet
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53132:208"/> before a treaſure with labour. The Sluggard would do evil as other men, only he is unwilling to loſe his ſleep and eaſe, as they do to accompliſh their wicked deſigns; and he would do good as others, (I mean in regard of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Duties) only he is loth to be at the labour. Negative godlineſs requires on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſiting ſtill, and a forbearing to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with ſuch and ſuch things which God hath prohibited; but poſitive God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs (if to any purpoſe) requires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and zeal, and activity, and the putting forth our ſtrength and ſpirits, which makes the idle Wretch take his leave of it. The ſlothful Servant could let his Talent lie ſtill in the Earth, and not lay it out in gaming and rioting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and continue his ſlothfulneſs; but if he had improved it, in trading for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters profit, he muſt have gone up and down, and taken pains.</p>
               <p>It's eaſie to forbear curſing, and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and blaſpheming the Name of God; theſe may ſuit well with a torpid idle perſon, but <hi>to call on the Name of God, to pray fervently, to pray without ceaſing, to lift up to the Soul in prayer, to pour out</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:53132:209"/> the heart, to ſtir up ones ſelf to wraſtle with God, to ſeek him with all the heart, with the whole heart; this will require ſome pains and labour, and this makes him forbear it. Again, it's no great pains for a man to keep himſelf from hearing laſcivious, vain, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, or flattering, or evil Language; a man may but forbear coming into ſuch company, or depart from them, when he underſtandeth them about ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; but for a man to hear the Word of God, with <hi>reverence,</hi> as the Word of God; with <hi>meekneſs,</hi> as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be govern'd by it; with Faith, as believing all the Promiſes and Threatnings of it to be of unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble certainty, and with a reſolution to practiſe it, as knowing we ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it at the day of Chriſt; this will coſt ſome head and heart work, which the ſleepy Drone is unwilling to come to.</p>
               <p>Again, the right performance of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in regard of the manner, requires much more pains than in regard of the matter; therefore they who take upon them a Form, deny the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53132:209"/> and who are not guilty of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, are yet of internal Omiſſions. How many pray or mumble over a few words Morning and Evening to God, (and are pleaſed with it, as if therefore all were well, and think God pleaſed too,) who never trouble themſelves with minding that reverence, humility, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, ſenſe of want, Faith in Chriſt, importunity of deſires which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects in every prevalent Prayer; and the reaſon is, becauſe the former is ſo eaſie, and the latter ſo laborious.</p>
               <p>Beſides, for a man to examine his own heart frequently and impartially, and to call himſelf to a ſtrict account what he hath been and done in the World, and what is like to become of him, and to befal him for ever; for him to take the Looking-Glaſs of the Law of God, and therein to behold his Heart and Life, and having compared his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the Divine Precepts, which are exceeding broad, to accuſe, and judge, and condemn, and loath, and abhor himſelf; for him to lay himſelf low before the Lord, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſs with ſhame, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53132:210"/> and grief, his filthineſs and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to beg Pardon &amp; Grace, as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly as one that believes, if his requeſts be denied, his poor Soul is damned for ever. Friend, Friend, this is hard and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work, and the idle man will not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Once more, he that will be poſitively holy, muſt watch himſelf in all his ways, muſt watch for opportunities of Service to God; he muſt catch at them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, when he hath them put into his hand; he muſt ſtand always upon his guard, to defend himſelf againſt his enemies; and be as a Sparrow upon the houſe-top, to look about and conſider where he may pick up any ſpiritual food for his Soul; he muſt deſign, and ſtudy, and contrive how he may ſpend his time, and parts, and ſtrength, and eſtate to the beſt advantage of his Lord and Maſter; and think nothing too much, no pains, no labour, no not his blood for his Lord's Honour; and will a ſluggard that lieth with his hands in his boſom do this, or any part of this? Ah Friend, the ſleepy World dream of Happineſs upon eaſie terms, as if they could walk to Heaven in a pleaſant Meadow, or be
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53132:210"/> carried to Heaven in a Down-bed; but it muſt not be, it cannot be; <hi>Difficilia quae pulchra.</hi> Canſt thou obtain any thing that is excellent, unleſs thou art diligent? Doth the Tradeſman get an Eſtate, who is not induſtrious to look after his Cuſtomers, his Books, and whatſoever concerns his Calling? Can he who ſits ſtill in his Chimney-corner, and neither minds buying in, nor ſelling out; nor takes care how things are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in his Shop, ever exſpect to be rich? <hi>Reader,</hi> if ever thou wilt make any thing of it, there is a neceſſity of ſhaking off this ſlothfulneſs. I muſt tell thee, an idle perſon is the Devils Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his own burden, unlike and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to God, and a wem in the Body Politick where he lives. To cure this, <hi>Reader,</hi> I muſt ſay to thee, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Epheſians, Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ariſe from the dead,</hi> Epheſ. 5.14. Friend, thy work is not to be done ſleeping; God-work, Soul-work, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity-work is not to be done ſleeping. Labouring, wraſtling, fighting, ſtriving, running, are not to be done ſleeping, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.13.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53132:211"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Doſt thou think to attain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Pleaſures, and not to take pains? Doth God value his bliſsful Manſions at ſo low a rate, as to throw them away upon thoſe who ſlight them, and judge them unworthy their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? Is the price of Heaven fallen ſince the Redeemers being in the World? then it was, <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof,</hi> Matth. 6.33. <hi>And ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> Matth. 7.33. <hi>And labour for the meat that endureth to everlasting life,</hi> Matth. 6.27. And is it now laze and loyter, and be bleſſed for ever. Though God doth not exſpect from thee a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral price for his Son, that is impoſſible for Men or Angels to give; yet he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that pactional price which he hath ſet down in his Word, as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that ſhall have a part in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> doſt thou know what pains the Merchant takes for corruptible Treaſures, how he ventures his life in a wooden-bottom, and a tempeſtuous Ocean, and is every moment in danger of death; how he ſails from Haven to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53132:211"/> Haven, diſpoſing and exchanging Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, trading and trafficking with perſons of divers Countries and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and all to get a little wealth; and if worldly Pearls cannot be had without pains, doſt thou think the Pearl of great and ineſtimable price, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the fruits of his precious blood may be had for nothing. I tell thee, as God valued his Son at ſo high a rate, as to accept of his temporary ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as fuller ſatisfaction to his Juſtice on the behalf of millions of Souls; than if they had fryed millions of millions of millions of years in Hell; ſo God will make thee value and prize him, if ever thou partake any benefit by him. And if thou once comeſt to know his worth, and to eſteem him accordingly; thou wilt think no toil, no ſweat; nay, no blood too good or too much for him.</p>
               <p>Friend, ponder the work of poſitive Godlineſs, and then judge whether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence be not requiſite. Cloſet-Duties, as praying, reading, ſelf-examining, and Family-Duties muſt daily be performed, and that with life and vigor, and all the Soul, and all the ſtrength: Thy earthly
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53132:212"/> Calling muſt be followed with heavenly affections; and whilſt thy Occupation is amongſt men, thy Converſation muſt be with God. In all Companies, and at all Seaſons, and in all Conditions, thou art to be in the fear of God, and watchful over thy ſelf, that thou doſt nothing to diſpleaſe him, and ſolicitous how thou mayſt do that which is moſt pleaſing to him. Thou muſt love God with all thy heart, when he ſeems moſt angry with thee; and truſt in his goodneſs, when he inflicts never ſo great or ſo many evils on thee. Thy duty is to believe in a crucified Chriſt, and ſo venture thy Soul on the death of another, upon the bare war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Scripture; thou art required to deny, and bemoan, and abhor thy ſelf, as near and dear as thou art to thy ſelf, to mortifie thy earthly members, and to cut off thy right hand, and pluck out thy right eye. Not a Relation, not a Condition, not an Ordinance, not a Providence, but calls for Duties, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duties to be performed, and not one of theſe Duties but calls for ſuitable Graces to be exerciſed. Beſides, ere theſe Duties can be performed, and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:53132:212"/> theſe Graces exerciſed, many ſtrong and ſturdy luſts muſt be ſubdued; the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements on one hand of a flattering, gaudy, giddy, ſkin-deep World, as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies to pleaſe Children, trampled on; and its afrightments, as Cloths ſtuft with ſtraw, to ſcare Birds, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. I, and all the Powers and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Hell combated with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. And, Friend, can all this be done with thy hands in thy Pocket, or without pains. It's in vain to think of freedom from Omiſſions, whilſt thou lieſt on the bed of Security. Water corrupteth, and breeds venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whilſt it ſtandeth ſtill; it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſweet by motion, as we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in running-ſtreams. The unuſed Iron ruſteth, whilſt that which is uſed groweth daily more bright. Neither Nature nor Art will afford us any thing that is good without labour. The ground will not yield its fruit, unleſs the Huſbandman dung, and plow, and dreſs, and harrow it. Can any Artiſt make an excellent Clock, or Watch, or curious Veſſel without pains? And wilt thou preſume of Holineſs and Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53132:213"/> it? The Heavens are ever in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the benefit of this lower World, and never ſtand ſtill but by a Miracle. The Earth is always labouring to bring forth fruit for our profit and delight, and never idle and barren, but as curſed of God for mans ſin. <hi>Adam</hi> in his eſtate of Innocency, was by God himſelf taught a Leſſon of Induſtry, and commanded to till the ground. Our bleſſed Saviour was not idle; but when he undertook the work of mans Redemption, went up and down doing good, denying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his ſleep. A great while before day he was at prayer, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. and he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all night. He denied himſelf his Food when he was hungry, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of Food at the Figg-Tree; he goeth not to an houſe to eat, but to the Synagogue to preach. He denied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his eaſe and pleaſure, and all to follow his buſineſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.4. As he ſaid, ſo he did; <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me whilſt it is day.</hi> And did Chriſt contend, and fight, and ſtrive, and wraſtle night and day before he was crown'd, or could enjoy the Joy ſet before him; and doſt thou think to have all for nothing?</p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:53132:213"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> to conclude this Head conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Not ſlothful in buſineſs, fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Where we have the Duty (I am perſwading thee to) commanded by the Apoſtle (in regard of its great weight, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary difficulty, or backwardneſs to it,) both ways: 1. Negatively, not ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in buſineſs; <hi>i. e.</hi> you will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at it if ye be ſleepy or ſlothful; the buſineſs is not ſuch as may be done in a dream. As idleneſs is the burial of our perſons, ſo ſlothfulneſs is the burial of our actions. It's bad to be ſlow at our buſineſs, but much worſe to be ſlothful. 2. Affirmatively, <hi>fervent in Spirit;</hi> this is the greateſt diligence poſſible. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency is the heat and height of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and is as contrary to ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as fire to water. When the powers and faculties of the Soul are wound up to their higheſt pitch in the Service of God; then a man may be ſaid <hi>to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit.</hi> The labour of the body is nothing to the labour of the brains, and the ſweating of the outward man is little to the induſtry of the inward man. He that hath the heart of a man, may
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53132:214"/> command his purſe and hands, and what he hath. Fervency of Spirit, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mind about any buſineſs, will call in his time, and wealth, and ſtrength, and all to its aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Duty is urged by an high and weighty reaſon, ſerving the Lord. It's the Majeſty, Excellency, Purity, and boundleſs Perfection of the Object, which requires ſuch warmth, and life, and heat, and fervency of Spirit in thoſe that adore him. Though we may make bold with our fellow-duſt and aſhes, with thoſe that are of the ſame make and mould with our ſelves; yet the moſt High, <hi>he whoſe Name alone is Excellent, the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, to whom the whole Creation is leſs than nothing;</hi> he is not to be made bold with. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Being and Perfections command the higheſt and the hotteſt affections. The greateſt Prince muſt not be put off with leſs than the greateſt Preſent.</p>

That when they are called to the performance of this or that Duty, they neglect it with this excuſe, that it is but one Duty they live in the neglect of, or it can be no great matter for once to omit it. <hi>Reader,</hi> I ſhall handle theſe ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſhew firſt, that theſe fooliſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes which men pleaſe themſelves with, do cauſe Omiſſions, and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to the cure of each ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:53132:215"/>1. The firſt excuſe is, that Omiſſions are ſmall ſins, and this Opinion is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally rooted in all men. Becauſe they do not fly in the face of Conſcience, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the light of Reaſon, trouble the Societies where, and debauch the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt whom we live, as ſome ſins of Commiſſion do; therefore thy fancy (for it is but a fancy) that they are light and little, and no great matter is to be made of them. When once a man hath ſuckt in this poyſonous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no wonder if his heart ſwell, and his life ſwarm with ſuch ſins. For when his Nature hath a reluctancy againſt the poſitive Precepts, (much more than againſt the negative) and his lazy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſets him farther off, and he believes that they are Peccadilloes, and little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by God; yea, that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the High Court of Heaven is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in courſe for ſuch ſmall offences; what ſhould hinder but he ſhould abound and continue in them to the end of his life, unleſs his judgment of them be alter'd.</p>
               <p>In all our converſes and dealings, we are moſt careleſs about matters which
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53132:215"/> we judge to be of ſmall concernment. For 'tis judged a part of folly to be very ſolicitous about toys and trifles. If I have a ſlight cut on my Finger, or my ſkin razed, I poſſibly let it go, and am nothing troubled about it; but if a bone be broken, or a vital part infected, I am not a little perplexed, and quickly apply the beſt means for the cure of it. The leſs I apprehend the danger to be, the leſs care I take to prevent it.</p>
               <p>We ſee it by experience about the Laws of men, that thoſe Laws, the breach of which they preſume will be generally winked at, and little taken notice of by the Magiſtrate (as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Beggars, and ſeveral others,) are ſeldom obſerved, and men at moſt are indifferent whether they keep them or no; but for thoſe Laws which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will be ſeverely reckon'd for, if men break them; as thoſe againſt Thefts, Murthers, Raviſhments, Treaſons, and the like; theſe they will be tender of, and take care leſt they ſhould incur their penalties. Truly, ſo it is about the Laws of God; we do uſually make
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53132:216"/> ſome conſcience of thoſe Laws which we apprehend have Death, and Hell, and Wrath, and Damnation attending the breach of them; but thoſe Laws, the breach of which we preſume is no great matter, and little minded by God, we are careleſs and indifferent about.</p>
               <p>To cure this, <hi>Reader,</hi> conſider theſe three or four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I grant, that there are degrees of Sin: All ſins are not of the ſame ſize, nor every Sinner of the ſame ſtature. All ordinary Births which Satan begets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of men are not of the ſame bigneſs; yet ſometimes we find Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters born. Some ſins are compared to Camels, others to Gnats, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.24. Some to Motes, others to Beams, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.3. Some to Talents, others to Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things or Pence. Our Saviour tells us of a Creditor who had two Debtors, the one owed much more than the other, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.41. So <hi>Luke</hi> 16.5. Some ſins are pardonable, other ſins unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53132:216"/> forgiven unto men.</hi> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> (as <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> obſerves in his Paradoxes, and the <hi>Jovinians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 29. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> teſtifieth in his Second Book againſt them, ſided with them,) held, That all ſins were equal, becauſe all ſins are aberrations from the rule, and a going beyond the bounds; but it is to be conſidered that ſome may wander farther from their rule, and out of their way than others. Some may ſhoot wider than others, though both miſs the mark.</p>
               <p>A ſin againſt the Firſt Table, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> is greater than a ſin againſt the Second, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. as being more immediately againſt God. Whereas all ſin hath its ſinfulneſs from its oppoſition and offenſiveneſs to ſo infinite a Majeſty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned.</hi> Thus we read that Witch-craft and Idolatry, which directly diſown God as the greateſt ſins, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13. And our Lord Jeſus, when aſked what was the firſt and great Commandment, anſwers, <hi>To love the Lord our God with all our hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.11. Spiritual ſins are greater than bodily ſins; 1. As thoſe by which we moſt imitate the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53132:217"/> Devil, who is for ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. All ſin is from Satan <hi>per modum ſervitutis;</hi> but theſe ſins <hi>per modum imaginis.</hi> 2. As thoſe ſins by which we moſt directly oppoſe God, who is a Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. and therefore God moſt directly ſets himſelf in battel-array againſt them. 3. As thoſe ſins that defile and pollute moſt the chiefeſt part of man, his ſpirit, in which regard the Apoſtle calls them <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of ſpirit;</hi> and diſtinguiſheth them from the <hi>filthineſs of the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. 4. As thoſe ſins which are the ſpring of all bodily and outward ſins; <hi>Out of the heart proceed Murders, Blaſphemies, Thefts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. 5. As thoſe ſins have more of the heart and ſpirit in them; the malignity of ſin, in regard of its Object, is from the immenſity of that God againſt whom it is committed; in regard of its Subject, it's from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that heartineſs and willingneſs with which it is committed. To back-ſlide in heart, is more than back-ſlide from God with our tongues, and deny him vocally, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Such a one ſhall be filled with his own ways and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</hi>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:53132:217"/> To err in heart, is the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation indeed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.10. To err in heart is much worſe than to err in our heads; the more of the heart and ſpirit in any Service, the more lovely and acceptable to God; the more of the heart and ſpirit in any ſin, the more loathſome and abominable to God. 6. As thoſe ſins which have their full ſcope and ſwing. In bodily ſins a man is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as in Uncleanneſs, by the weakneſs or wearineſs of his Body; in Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Luxury, and Pride, by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Eſtate; in Murder, by his Antagoniſt's ſtrength, or his fear of the Law, or want of opportunity: But ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſins have none of theſe obſtacles or hinderances. He whoſe Body is ſo weak, that he cannot know one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, may yet in his Spirit defile hundreds in one day. He whoſe Eſtate is ſo ſmall, that he can ſcarce maintain himſelf, will yet in his thoughts keep a Table for a Prince, throw away hundreds upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the Fleſh, and be as great an Emperour as he pleaſeth. He whoſe ſickneſs, and lowneſs of quality, and want of a convenient ſeaſon, hindreth
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53132:218"/> him from doing his Neighbour the leaſt actual injury, may yet in his Spirit ſlay more than <hi>Sampſon</hi> did with the jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of an Aſs in a much leſs time.</p>
               <p>Sins againſt Knowledge are greater than ſins of Ignorance. Our Saviour tells the <hi>Jews, That if they had been blind, they had had no ſin; but becauſe ye ſay ye ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth,</hi> Joh. 9. Sins againſt knowledge are ſins againſt our own light, and thereby we offer violence to our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, <hi>to</hi> 28.2. More daring to God; for he who is ignorant of his Maſters will, cannot do any thing, or omit any thing to dare him or to provoke him, becauſe he doth not know what is diſpleaſing to him; but he who knoweth what God would have, and omits what he commandeth, or doth what he forbids, may rather be ſuppoſed to commit the one or omit the other, becauſe of his enmity to God. 3. As more againſt the mercy of God. Knowledge is a great mercy: <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Man is the Candle of the Lord.</hi> And ſins againſt it are therefore the more provoking, becauſe againſt the Divine goodneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4. Theſe ſins
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53132:218"/> againſt knowledge make way for the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. Sins againſt the Goſpel are greater than ſins againſt the Law. Thoſe ſins are againſt the natural Law, the moral, and the Law of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. and are committed in the face of the Sun, as they are againſt the cleareſt Light, ſo they are againſt the ſweeteſt Love, and therefore the more ſinful. A Taper in the hand of a Ghoſt makes it look the more gaſtly; <hi>This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> Joh. 3.19.</p>
               <p>Sins repeated and reiterated, are much greater than ſins once committed: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the habit of Sin is ſtrengthened; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acts root the habits. Hereby the long-ſuffering of God is abuſed; for the more patient he is, the more he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. As in Numbers, one in the firſt place ſtands but for a ſingle one, in the ſecond place ten, in the third place for an hundred, the fourth place for a thouſand; ſo here, each Repetition is a great aggravation; <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardneth his heart, ſhall be</hi> (ſee the grievouſneſs of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, not afflicted, but) <hi>deſtroyed</hi>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:53132:219"/> (the quickneſs of it) <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> (and the irrecoverableneſs of it) and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy. It's one thing to fall into the water, another thing to lie there; 'tis the latter that drowns men.</p>
               <p>The Sins of the people of God are greater reſpectively than the Sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; therefore they are ſaid <hi>only to do evil,</hi> as if all the World beſide were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. <hi>The Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and the Children of</hi> Judah <hi>have only done evil before me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.6</note> 1. As theſe Sins are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the greateſt Obligations on Gods part, againſt the electing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, pardoning, adopting, ſaving-love, each of theſe is an aggravation of Sin. God accents <hi>Iſraels</hi> Sin from his ſpecial kindneſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. Although I was an Huſband to them. 2. As they are committed againſt the moſt ſolemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements on our part. Every of Gods people doth expreſly before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Men, promiſe and covenant to be the Lords, wholly, univerſally, and eternally the Lords. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched God to be theirs. And <hi>David</hi> ſwore that he would be Gods obedient Servant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>I have ſworn, and I
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:53132:219"/> will perform, that I will keep thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgments.</hi> And it's no mean Sin to be guilty of Perjury. God aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the Sin of his people by this, <hi>They all like men have tranſgreſſed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> 3. As theſe Sins are committed againſt the greateſt helps to Obedience; An enlightned Mind, a renewed Will, ſanctified Affections, an awakned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a principle of Life or new Nature, are all oppoſed and reſiſted by their Diſobedience. This cut the heart of <hi>David,</hi> that God made him to know Wiſdom ſecretly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6. 4. As the Sins of theſe men cauſe God to be more blaſphemed and diſhonoured than the Sins of others, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.31. <hi>Nathan</hi> tells <hi>David, By this deed thou haſt given great occaſion to the enemies of God to blaſpheme,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.14. Indeed, theſe by falling into ſin after their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſeem to repent of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to lick up their Vomit.</p>
               <p>Sins of Omiſſion may be greater in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perſon committing them, a Believer, in regard of the means the Offender enjoyeth. The Word of the Divine Grace, in regard of the matter
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:53132:220"/> he omits, the Duties of the Goſpel, and in many other reſpects than Sins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions in others, who have not ſuch circumſtances.</p>
               <p>It is very evident, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that Sins are unequal; for though Original Sin, as the Logicians ſay of <hi>Subſtantia,</hi> be not capable of <hi>magis &amp; minus,</hi> of intenſion or remiſſion, of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation or diminution; yet actual ſins are like qualities and quantities which receive more or leſs addition or ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and have their Latitude and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. For this cauſe under the Law there were diverſity of Sacrifices for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Sin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer, that no ſins are little ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: Though there is a difference of ſins conſider'd comparatively, and ſo ſins may be ſaid to be little, if compared with thoſe that are more hainous; yet no ſins abſolutely conſider'd are little. The leaſt Sin reſembleth the Earth, which though but a point to the Heavens, yet is a vaſt immeaſurable Body in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe all ſins are againſt a great and infinite Majeſty. <hi>Reader,</hi> it's the excellency of the Perſon whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53132:220"/> is contemned, and Commands vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and whoſe Name is diſhonoured by ſin that gives ſin its name, ſpeaks its hainous Nature, and is the higheſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.23. and this is done in all Sins. Friend, till thou canſt hear of a little God contemned, abuſed, diſgraced, and reſiſted by Sin, ſpeak no more of little ſins in excuſe for thy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the price paid to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for all ſins of what ſize or ſort ſoever, was a great price. It is the blood, the precious blood of the Son of God,<note place="margin">Liv. 5.17, 18.</note> and that only that can waſh away the leaſt Sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Aaron</hi> muſt offer Sacrifice for pollution in a mans dream, that he never thought of poſſibly but in ſleep. And for the Sins which the <hi>Jews</hi> committed ignorantly, not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be any offence to God; and in anſwer to thoſe Types our Redeemer is ſaid to die for the ignorance, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the people. <hi>Reader,</hi> till that thou canſt tell of a Sin ſo little, that ſomewhat leſs than the death of him who was God will ſatisfie for it, call no Sin little.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:53132:221"/>3. Becauſe no little puniſhment is the due and deſert of every Sin. <hi>The wages of Sin is Death,</hi> and Hell, and infinite Wrath of an Almighty God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its the wages of every Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult. A quatenus ad omne valet conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> Becauſe fire as fire burns, therefore every fire burns; becauſe Sin as Sin damneth, therefore every Sin damneth. So that all Sins bring greater intollerable eternal Sufferings. Endleſs baniſhment from the bliſsful preſence of God and Chriſt, everlaſting burnings amongſt Devils and damned Ones, is the deſert of every Sin. <hi>Reader,</hi> when thou canſt tell of a little Fire, and little Torments in Hell, and little horrors and terrors of Soul, there to be the fruit of Sin: Call not any of thy ſins little. Another thing, <hi>Reader,</hi> I would advertiſe thee of; No Sin is little to him who thinks it ſo. Sins may be ſaid to be mortal or venial: 1. In reſpect of their own Nature, and ſo no Sins are venial; but the leaſt is mortal. 2. In reſpect of the Divine Favour. 3. In regard of the Iſſue. In the two laſt reſpects, all the ſins of ſuch as believe and repent are venial; not
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:53132:221"/> in the Popiſh ſenſe, ſo as to be in their own nature no tranſgreſſions, but prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-tranſgreſſions of the Divine Law, and not properly ſins, but analogically, but they are venial, as God for Chriſt's ſake doth forgive them. Either thoſe Sins which they term venial, are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Law of God or not; if not, they are no Sins, or the Law of God is imperfect; if they be forbidden, they are mortal. <hi>For curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do it,</hi> Gal. 3.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I anſwer, ſuppoſe Sins of Omiſſion were little, yet it is folly and madneſs upon this to allow of them. A mote in the eye is a little thing, it hindereth our ſight of the Sun, and is big enough to put us to great pain, and to diſturb our whole Body. The Flies and Lice of <hi>Egypt</hi> were little Creatures, but great Plagues. The ſting of a Bee is a little thing, but it puts us to grievous torment. He who refuſed to give a few crumbs, was denied one drop, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.21. A flie ſpoils an Alablaſter Box of Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a little poyſon ſpoils much whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Liqour.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:53132:222"/>1. If they were little, yet they are Sins, and that enough to ſet a good man againſt them. It's as much Treaſon to Coin a peny, as a twenty ſhillings piece; becauſe the Royal Authority is as much violated in the one as in the other. There is the ſame rotundity in a little Ball or Bullet, as in a great one. The Authority of God is as truly deſpiſed in the breach of the leaſt Commandments, as ſome are called, as in the breach of the greateſt, as others are called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.36, 37. A ſprig of Wormwood hath the ſame bitterneſs with the Plant. A drop of Sea-water hath the ſame ſaltneſs with the Ocean. The ſmalleſt Sin is a breach of the Royal Law as well as the greateſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. Though the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may be different, yet the Command is ſtill the ſame. And the wiſe man tells us, That the Law muſt be kept as the apple of the Eye, which is offended by the ſmalleſt duſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.2. The brats of <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt be daſhed againſt the Wall, as the ſtrongeſt men muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoyed.</p>
               <p>It's worth the while to obſerve in Scripture how leſſer Sins (being of the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:53132:222"/> ſame nature) have given to them the names of the greater. Malice is called <hi>Murder,</hi> luſtful looks <hi>Adultery,</hi> ſitting at Idolatrous Feaſts (though which no thought of worſhipping the Idol) <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Job</hi> 31.27, 28.</p>
               <p>This is argument enough againſt the ſmalleſt Sin, that it is a Sin. As the Will of God is the higheſt motive to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo alſo againſt Diſobedience. All Sin, as Sin, affronts the Divine Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as if he had not Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us; and to the Divine Wiſdom, as if God did not know what were fit for us to do, and to forbear; and to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, as if he had no reſpect to our good in his Precepts; and is not this ſufficient reaſon for our hatred of it, and watchfulneſs againſt it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> I Know thou wouldſt not venture upon a ſpoonful of Poyſon, but wouldſt conſider its of the ſame nature with a pint or a quart; and why wilt thou venture on any Sin, be it never ſo little in thine eye, when it is of the ſame nature, a tranſgreſſion of the ſame Law, a contempt of the ſame Lord with the greateſt. It is Murder to ſtifle an Infant
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53132:223"/> in the Womb, as well as to kill a grown perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> whatſoever hath the nature of Sin, muſt be the Object of thy hatred, let it be comparatively little or great.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe little ſins (if they be ſo) will make way for greater. Little wedges open the way in the moſt knotty wood for bigger. As Thieves, when they go to rob an Houſe, if they cannot force open the doors, or break through the Walls, let in a little Boy at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, who unbolts and unlocks the door, and ſo lets in the whole Rabble. Thus the Devil, when men ſtartle at greater ſins, and by them he hath no hopes to get poſſeſſion of their Souls, he puts them upon thoſe ſins which they think little, and by theſe inſenſibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for they once admitted, open the doors of the Eyes, of the Ears, and of the Heart too, whereby the whole Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion enter, and rule and domineer in their Souls to their ruine. Men do not, indeed they cannot imagine the woful conſequences of neglecting their watch againſt the leaſt Sin. How many who have been ſo modeſt and maidenly at
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53132:223"/> firſt, that they would not ſo much as give a laſcivious perſon the hearing, when he hath ſpoken wantonly; yet by giving way to their own fooliſh thoughts, have at laſt proſtituted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their pleaſure without any ſhame. Sinners increaſe to more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, when they once venture down hill, they know not where nor when to ſtop. Work-men bore holes with little Wimbles, which make way for the driving of great Nails.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> could not prevail with a City to billet his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he yet perſwaded them to take in a few weak maimed Souldiers; but thoſe ſoon recovered ſtrength, and let in the whole Army, to command and govern the City. Thus Satan by ſins of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity prevails at length for ſins of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Great ſtorms ariſe out of little guſts; and Clouds no bigger than the palm of a mans hand, comes in time to cover the whole Heavens. The greateſt River is fed with drops, and the biggeſt Mountain made up of atomes. As <hi>Sylla</hi> ſaid, when (in his Proſcription time, that he ſlew ſo many) one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:53132:224"/> for the life of <hi>Caeſar, In uno Caeſare multi Marii.</hi> In one little Youth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old ſubtle men; ſo in one little Sin, there may be many great ones. When one evil Spirit hath got lodging in the Heart, he prepares it, and makes room for ſeven more wicked and worſe than himſelf.</p>
               <p>Keepers firſt ply their Deer with little Beagles till it be heated and blown, and then they put on their great Buck-Hounds. So the Devil firſt plies us with little ſins, afterwards when we are uſed to them with greater.

Thus Sin incroacheth by degrees upon the Soul, if it can get but one of its claws into us, it will quickly follow with its head and whole body. <hi>A little Leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</hi> Unfaithfulneſs to God is firſt diſcovered in the ſmalleſt matters, then it proceeds to greater
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53132:224"/> things. As the decay of a Tree is firſt viſible in its twigs, but by degrees it goeth on the bigger Arms, and from them to the main body.</p>
               <p>As it is the nature of a Cancer or Gangreen to run from one Joynt or part of the Body to another, from the Toe to the Foot, from the Foot to the Leg, from the Leg to the Thigh, and thence to the vital parts. Do we not ſometimes ſee a whole Arm impoſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the prick of a little Finger, and have we not ſometimes heard of a great City betray'd, by the opening of a little Poſtern. Theſe little ſins will grow to great ones, if let alone. Time will turn ſmall duſt into ſtone.

               <p>It's obſervable how God urgeth the Command to abſtain from blood (which ſeems a ſmall matter) with this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as they deſire God to do any good for them or theirs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. and upon pain of death. Friend, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing, a prick of a thorn feſtring, the kernel of a Raiſin, a ſmall bone in thy Throat may deprive thee of thy natural life; and theſe little ſins, as thou calleſt them, may hinder thee of eternal life. A ſmall leak in a Ship unſtopt, may ſink it. A dram of poyſon diffuſeth it ſelf to all parts, till it ſeize and ſtrangle the vital Spirits.

Gods thoughts are not as their thoughts in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.3. <hi>The Soul that ſins ſhall die,</hi> without a diſtinction.

I have been guilty of a little Sin, and without Repentance, I muſt die eternally for it. A little ſpark may kindle ſuch a fire as may burn down a whole City.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How little ſoever they ſhould be in their own nature, they become great by thy allowance. The nature of Sin ſtands not ſo much in the material part of it, which is often little, but principally in the form or anomy, which is the breach of Gods Law, and alſo in the manner or carriage of the heart in its Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. A Sin may be great <hi>in abſtracto,</hi>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:53132:226"/> as the fact is meaſured by the Law, and as the matter of it may be, and yet ſmall <hi>in concreto;</hi> and by circumſtances as not allowed of, or domineering in the Soul. On the other ſide, a Sin may be ſmall, as meaſured by the Law, or according to the nature of the fact; and yet great by circumſtances, as liked and approved by us. In a Corporation, a man of a great Eſtate and Quality may be an inferior and underling in point of Authority and Sway; and one that is of ſmall Eſtate or Degree may be chief Governour. Sick Bodies love to be gratified with ſome little bit which they love, though it never ſo much favour their Diſeaſe. As ſome Favours we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God are little in their kind, but great in their circumſtances, and ſo very ingaging to the Creature; as to have a little Food ſent in, when a man is ſtarving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So there are ſome Sins which may be ſmall in their nature, but by the time when, or wilfulneſs of the Sinner, may be very great. For a man to commit a Sin materially greater, is not ſo great a Sin as to commit a leſſer with deliberation. To commit actual
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53132:226"/> Adultery out of ignorance, or for want of advice, is not ſo great a Sin, as for a man to be guilty of adulterous thoughts with allowance, and adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Reader,</hi> take heed of this, for thou wilt find at laſt that it will be an hard thing to give them comfort, who ſin with counſel, though in ſmall matters. A ſin little in its nature, the more it's allowed, and the more wilfully commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the greater it is; nay, it may be much greater than Sins materially great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; if theſe be not committed <hi>plena vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate,</hi> with a full conſent of will. As a little ſtone thrown with a ſtrong Arm will do more harm than a much greater ſtone thrown with a weak Arm. So a little Sin committed with ſecurity, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and allowance, will more waſt the Conſcience, and wound the Soul, than far greater out of infirmity and inadvertency. Petty Princes uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the cruelleſt Tyrants, and do the moſt miſchief to their Subjects. Friend, doſt thou not conſider where ever Sin reigneth, it is horrid hainous, moſt defiling and damning; and thy lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sins may reign as well as great ones.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53132:227"/> There have been Kings of Countries, (as here in <hi>England</hi> in the time of the Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy) nay, of Cities among the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as well as Emperors of vaſt and large Dominions. There are Mayors and Conſtables commanding in chief in their places, as well as Juſtices and Judges. A little hair hanging in the pen may make a great blot, and thy lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sins allowed, will very greatly defile and wound thy Soul. In this ſenſe, what the Philoſopher ſaith is true, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="5">5. The baſer and unworthier art thou to fall out with thy beſt Friend for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſmall matter. Ah, how great is thy ingratitude to diſobey, and provoke, and diſpleaſe, and diſhonour the bleſſed God, to whom thou art ſo infinitely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged for a poor ſmall buſineſs? And what folly and madneſs is it to forfeit the Divine Favour, and incur his Anger, and to expoſe thy ſelf to infinite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for a trifle, a bable, a light, little, inconſiderable thing. God aggravates the Sin of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and threatneth them
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:53132:227"/> ſeverely for it, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.6. <hi>That they ſold the poor for a pair of ſhooes;</hi> that they ſold what was of ſo great value, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a pair of ſhooes, ſo poor and mean a price. Friend, how will he deal with thee, if thou ſelleſt thy own Soul and eternal ſalvation, the blood of thy Saviour, the love of thy Father, and all the joys and delights of the other World, for a pair of ſhooes; for that which thou thy ſelf acknowledgeſt is but a ſmall and little matter. Truly, the leſs the thing, the greater thy contempt in denying to do it. Ah, who will ſtand with his God for a tittle, for a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Truly, the leſs the matter is, the greater is the malice that will offend and provoke God for it. How great is the unkindneſs to ſtand with God for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle? How little doſt thou eſteem thy God, the God of all Conſolation? how little doſt value his Love and Grace, and Favour, and endleſs fruition, to part with all for little or nothing?</p>
               <p>The leſs, <hi>Reader,</hi> the thing is for or about which thou ſinneſt, the greater is thy Sin. Believe it, that by which thou wouldſt excuſe thy ſin doth increaſe it. It
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:53132:228"/> hath been formerly ſaid, <hi>If a man will break his faith, it ſhould be for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> for ſomething of worth; yet this Sinner were a loſer, though by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Faith, he could gain the whole Earth; what then is that man who will lye and forſwear himſelf for a peny. Though no man ſhould preſume upon Sin, becauſe its preſent profit will be great; yet there is more unkindneſs, more folly, and more ſinfulneſs in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for a little. Some like Eagles, will not ſtoop at flies, ſcorn to ſin for a ſmall matter; others as Ants will be buſie about the leaſt duſt, will break the Law for a very little; the former are bad, the latter worſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The leſs they are, the more they call for thy care and caution; for they are the harder to be cured. As a wound made with a Bodkin, if deep, is hardlier cured than a wound with a Sword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Orifice is ſo ſmall, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly almoſt cloſeth up, and ſo the wound bleedeth inwardly, often to the death of the Patient. It's much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for the Mariner to avoid Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, that are hurried hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:53132:228"/> then known Rocks, though Sands are ſmall things, and Rocks are great vaſt bodies. Beſides our proneneſs to deſpiſe and ſlight them, cauſeth our more frequent falling into them, as alſo our lying longer in them without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Small Sins are not expiated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infinite ſatisfaction, and muſt they then be dallied with? there is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity in the leaſt ſin, than the whole Creation can expel; and more Venome than Men &amp; Angels can antidote againſt. Friend, conſider it, thou ſayſt they are little ſins, therefore I may live in them. Did Chriſt die for them, and wilt thou live in them? Doſt thou not know what prodigious drops of ſweat, what clods of blood, what ſtrong cries, and groans, and prayers, the leaſt Sins coſt thy Redeemer? Doſt thou not know that their weight was ſo heavy (as little and light as thou fancieſt them to be) that they preſſed and bruiſed his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Body, that they oppreſſed and amazed his bleſſed Soul; yea, that they made him, who is valour and courage it ſelf, obedience and dutifulneſs it ſelf,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:53132:229"/> love and pity it ſelf to ſhrink and draw back, and pray againſt his Duty to his Father, and his own Mercy to fallen man, and decline the very end and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand for which he came into the world. <hi>Reader,</hi> think of it. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, what matters it whether a Ship be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with one great Wave, or ſunk by a ſmall Cranny in the bottom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the water enters drop by drop. And elſe-where, what eaſeth it a man to be preſſed to death with an heap of ſmall ſand, more than with a ſow of lead; or to be ſtrangled with a pack-thread ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than with an halter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> I would not have thee think any of thy ſins little. It's unbecoming a Chriſtian to entertain ſuch a thought of his ſins; nay, it greatens his ſin, for him to preſume it is little. As we ſhould not leſſen the Mercies of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think them great, and too great for us, and our ſelves leſs than the very leaſt of them; ſo we ſhould never leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen our ſins, but judge the leaſt of them great, and the lighteſt of them heavy, and every of them too great and too heavy for us to bear; and upon theſe
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:53132:229"/> accounts loath and leave them. Friend, think of what I have ſaid of little ſins, and certainly thou wilt be of another mind than to allow of them, becauſe they are little; and rather reject them, becauſe they are ſins. Is there any thing that God hates but ſin, and muſt that be the Object of his hatred? Is there any thing that offends God, or grieves his Spirit, but ſin, and will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing delight and pleaſe thee, but what provokes and diſpleaſeth him?</p>
               <p n="4">4. I anſwer, that Omiſſions are not little ſins. I have already largely proved, that in ſome reſpects, and as they may be circumſtantiated, they may be much greater ſins than ſins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. <hi>Reader,</hi> conſider what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the danger of ſins of Omiſſion before the Uſes, and then judge whether they are little ſins or no.</p>
               <p>Are they little ſins which do moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Mind and Will of God, which make way for whole herds of Sins of Commiſſion, and which do exceedingly grieve the good Spirit of God? Are thoſe little ſins which God complains of ſo frequently, threatneth ſo ſeverely,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53132:230"/> and puniſheth with ſuch dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; on their Bodies, on their Souls, in this World, on both eternally, in the other World without any remedy? But, Friend, conſider farther;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Can that ſin be little which deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God the higheſt Honour, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Homage, and chiefeſt Reſpect which the Creature oweth to him? What is that which is the choiceſt Jewel in the Crown of his Glory? whence do the greateſt Revenews of his Honour flow? Are not our higheſt eſteem, our hotteſt love, or ſtrongeſt truſt, and our moſt reverential awe of his ſacred Majeſty, the beſt and the moſt we can give him; and can the omiſſion of theſe be a little ſin? The forbearance of Commiſſions is but the ſkirt, and garment, and out-ſide of that Obedience which we owe to God; it is the giving up our hearts and ſouls to him, in our moſt enlarged de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after him, and ſpiritual delights in him, and ſuperlative valuation of him, which he requireth of us, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looks after, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:53132:230"/> juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Surely, if any ſin be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it's that which incroacheth leaſt upon the honour of God, not that which injures ſo greatly his Royal Prerogative. He that robs his Soveraign of ſome petty goods, cannot be ſo great a Tranſgreſſor as he who would rob him of his Crown and Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is that a little ſin which provoketh God to inflict the greateſt puniſhment: Either we muſt believe that God puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men more or leſs, according to the nature of their offences, whether great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſſer, or elſe we muſt accuſe him of injuſtice. The Apoſtle undertakes to prove him righteous, <hi>becauſe he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to every man according to his works, Rom.</hi> 2.5, 6. If ſo, where he inflicts the greateſt Judgment, there muſt be the greateſt ſin. Now all Divines conclude, the puniſhment of loſs, which they ſay is for our Omiſſions, to be far greater than the puniſhment of ſenſe, which is for our Commiſſions. It's the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, That departing from God, and all good for ever, will vex and torture the Soul, more than the flames of Hell
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:53132:231"/> can pain and torment the Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is obſervable, that our Saviour ſometimes ſpeaks as if all the miſery of the damned were privative, and did conſiſt in their baniſhment from him. Then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you. <hi>Depart from me ye workers of Iniquity,</hi> Matth. 7.23. This is all. <hi>Poena damni poenalior eſt quam poena ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> Chriſ. As the Sinner hath neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do good. They have left off to be wiſe, and to do good. So he ſhall be baniſhed from all good, and that for ever. The Omiſſion of good was his Sin, and the amiſſion of good ſhall be his puniſhment. As he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo it ſhall be far from him. Ah how far will that be from the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſhall never never come to him. Friend, If the pain of loſs be greater than that of ſenſe, (for which cauſe in Scriptures, and Fathers, Hell-torments are called damnation,) and this pain of loſs be the puniſhment of thy Omiſſions, then it muſt needs follow, that Omiſſions are greater Sins than Commiſſions, and for that cauſe more ſeverely plagued by God. The preſence
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:53132:231"/> of God is the Heaven of Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. In thy preſence is fulneſs of joy;</hi> and the loſs of God is the Hell of Hell. <hi>They ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. Which loſs is the fruit of Omiſſions, and therefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> do not preſume them little.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is that Sin little which Chriſt could not ſatisfie for, without his obſervation of the whole Law. There was requiſite that Chriſt might be a compleat Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, both active and paſſive Obedience, His active anſwers our Omiſſions or Sins againſt the Precept; what was neglected by us, was performed by him; and his paſſive anſwers our Commiſſions or Sins againſt the prohibition; becauſe we do much evil, he ſuffer'd much evil. Now though we think this was a ſmall part of his Humiliation, yet upon ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration we ſhall find it otherwiſe. For him that was the great Law-Maker, to become the Law-Obſerver; For him that was above all Law, to be made under the Law, is a condeſcention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Love of God to be the greater,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53132:232"/> becauſe <hi>he ſent his Son made under the Law.</hi> As the Son of God, the infinite abſolute Lord of all, and Law-Maker to all, he might have pleaded exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Law; though the humane Nature, as a Creature, conſider'd ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from the Divine, was obliged to the obſervation of the Law; yet being in conjunction with the Deity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one Perſon with the Son of God, it was priviledged as to keeping the Law; but he humbled himſelf to do it, that he might ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice for our Omiſſions. Indeed, it is no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to men, no not to Angels, to be ſubject to the Law of God. It is as eſſential to them as their dependance is, by virtue of their Creatureſhip; but it was a great Humiliation in Chriſt to be bound to that Law of which he was Lord, eſpecially if we conſider theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he muſt be Man, before he could be made ſubject to the Law. For as God, he was altogether above it. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was made of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4. His Incarnation was the firſt, and greateſt,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:53132:232"/> and loweſt ſtep of his Humiliation. It was not ſo great a marvail, nor ſo great a ſuffering for Chriſt, being man, to die, as for the <hi>Son of God to become man;</hi> he emptied himſelf, <hi>and made himſelf of no reputation, when he was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man, Phil.</hi> 2.6. For God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man, was an emptying himſelf of his Credit, and ſtripping himſelf of his Robes of Glory, and is the firſt <hi>aenigma</hi> in the Apoſtles <hi>myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was bound to perfect perſonal Obedience upon pain of the Laws curſe. I mean not on pain of bearing the Laws curſe as he did, notwithſtanding his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience for others, but for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He was under the ſame Covenant with God, in regard of himſelf, that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was, and if he had failed in Obedience, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, his Humane Nature had been ſeparated from the Divine, and had periſhed withall in him for ever. That Covenant under which the Redeemer was for himſelf, had no grains of allowance for the leaſt infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, nor would admit of Repentance for the ſmalleſt defect or offence; ſo
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:53132:233"/> that if he had ſwerved the leaſt from the Law, he had been uncapable of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſatisfying for others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2. <hi>ult.</hi> and alſo had disjoyned the Humane Nature from the Divine, (which could not continue in Conjunction with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manhood,) and his Humane Nature with all he undertook for, muſt have born the curſe of the Law for ever. <hi>Reader,</hi> is that little, which coſt Chriſt ſo much to ſatisfie for? Was it eaſie to fulfil all Righteouſneſs, to obey all the rigid Exceptions of the Law to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to anſwer all its demands which was ſtill crying for work, yet afforded no help, neither allowed the leaſt mercy in caſe of failing. I hope thou wilt not hereafter live in any Omiſſion, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that it is but a little ſin, when it intrencheth ſo greatly upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Prerogative, hath the greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted on it in the other World, and brought <hi>the Son of God to be made of a Woman, and ſo to be made under the Law here,</hi> that he might ſatisfie for it: For if after all this thou ſhould continue in it, I muſt ſay to thee, as <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> with ſome alteration,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:53132:233"/>

Many perſons put off in a Morning Cloſet-Prayer, and Family-Duties, pretending they ſhall be better at leiſure before Noon, and thereby come to neglect them wholly for that part of the day. As <hi>Saul</hi> forbad the Prieſt to aſk Counſel of God, for want of leiſure, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.19. Others, when Alms are deſired of them, by fit Objects of Charity, will not deny them poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, but do it really, by deferring it till another ſeaſon, which the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures never ſee. Thus the Devil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth many Souls, by prevailing with them to delay their Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon pretence; hereafter will be
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:53132:234"/> time enough, and then ſuch and ſuch affairs will be over, and then they will be more at leiſure to mind them. If he can thus gain time of men, he doubts not but to make them loſe thereby an happy eternity; he is pleaſed well enough to hear men ſay, they muſt and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they muſt and will believe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are few in Hell who enjoyed the Goſpel, but ſometime or other ſaid as much; but as long as it is in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Tenſe, <hi>I will,</hi> and <hi>I will,</hi> and he can perſwade them that they are unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Duties at preſent; he fears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as knowing himſelf ſure enough of his prey.</p>
               <p>To take away this cauſe of Omiſſions, I ſhall anſwer this excuſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer, by confeſſing (that it may be) that ſome poſitive Duties may at ſome times be unſeaſonable. The beſt ſort of Food is not always in ſeaſon. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tells us, <hi>There is a time to ſow, and a time to reap, Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1, 2. All the year is not Seed-time, only ſome part of it. And it muſt be granted, that every thing is moſt beautiful in its ſeaſon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. then in its ſeaſon it is moſt luſtrous
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:53132:235"/> and lovely, moſt amiable and comely The grace and glory of an Action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth much in the right timing of it; therefore it is the praiſe of a good man, <hi>That he bringeth forth his fruit in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Pſal.</hi> 1. And it highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Wiſdom of God, that all his Actions are done in the neck, in the joynt, in the fitteſt opportunity poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent his Son, Gal.</hi> 4.3, 4. He hath out of his goodneſs allotted time for every Duty, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>There is a time to every purpoſe,</hi> and Duty for every part of time, ſo that a man can never ſay at this time, I have nothing to do. Nay, God hath allowed a ſeaſon, an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for every thing, wherein, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of helps and means, it may be done with moſt eaſe and advantage, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer, that ſome poſitive Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are never unſeaſonable. To honour our God, to work out our Salvation, to keep a good Conſcience, to love and believe in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in ſeaſon. Theſe, and ſuch like,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:53132:235"/> ought to be concommitant with every part of our time. <hi>Truſt in the Lord at all time,</hi> Pſal. 62.8. <hi>I will bleſs thy Name all the day. Bleſſed are they that keep Judgment, and do Righteouſneſs at all times, Pſal.</hi> 106.3. Therefore it is as ſome obſerve, that when <hi>Solomon</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a time for ſeveral things, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no time for doing evil, becauſe that muſt never be done; and no time for doing good, becauſe that muſt ever be done. That which ought to have no being, ſhould have no time to be in. That which ought always to be, needs not the mention of any particular time to be in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I anſwer, that no Duties are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, when more good than hurt is done by the preſent performance of them. To reprove our Neighbour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending is a Duty; yet if I knew that my reproving him at this time would make him curſe and ſwear, and ſin more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, I would defer it till another time; but if I thought that I ſhould not have another ſeaſon to do it in, and that preſent Reproof would only put him into a little pet or paſſion at preſent,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:53132:236"/> but afterwards probably he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it to his advantage, I would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the preſent opportunity. He that will omit that Duty till all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to his mind for the performance of it, muſt never perform it. There is hardly a ſtep to be taken in our Journey towards Heaven, but there is a block in the way to make us ſtumble at it, or go aſide for it: That if I will obſerve the Wind, I muſt not ſow at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I anſwer, Take heed that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the unſeaſonableneſs of Duties be not a device of the fleſh, and a wile of the Devil, to cloak and cover thy unwillingneſs to performance of them. It's eaſie to find ſome ſhift for every ſin; and truly there is none thou canſt live in, but Satan and thy own heart toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will help thee to ſufficient grounds for them. Scarce any are gone to Hell without ſome reaſon on their ſide for going thither.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I anſwer, that we muſt conſult God and his Word for Wiſdom to know, and faithfulneſs to perform our Duties in their beſt ſeaſons. <hi>The heart of the wiſe diſcerneth both time and judgment, Eccleſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:53132:236"/> 8.5. A good man that looks to God and his Word with a ſingle eye, deſiring to know what he ſhould do, and when he may do it beſt to the pleaſing of God, ſhall be taught and led by the Spirit of God in the way which he ſhould go in. <hi>The Word of God is perfect,</hi> and directs thee about the fitteſt ſeaſons for thy Duties. It teacheth thee when to mourn, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.22, 23. when to rejoyce, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.10. when to pray, and when to ſing, <hi>James</hi> 5.13. when to reprove, and when to be ſilent, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.13. when to give, and when to forbear giving, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.27. Yet ſtill there will be much need of Chriſtian prudence, and it may be helpful to thee to obſerve ſome general Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a greater good be preferred before a leſſer, and a more weighty Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty always have the precedency of what is leſs weighty. Though a leſſer good, and a leſs weighty Duty muſt be minded in their time and place, yet the greater muſt have the precedency, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. Publick advantage muſt not be crouded out, and put by for private, nor ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good give way to temporal. <hi>Shimei</hi>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:53132:237"/> ſhew'd his folly, in minding his wealth more than his life. And <hi>Mary,</hi> her wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was, improving the preſent time for her Soul, when <hi>Martha</hi> was troubled about other things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That generally the preſent time be laid hold on, and the firſt opportunity for the doing of good. Time is bald behind, and therefore its good to take it by the fore-lock. It's the Mariners wiſdom to take the firſt good Wind that offers it ſelf for his Voyage; and it may be the Merchants policy to take the firſt Chapman. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>While ye have time, do good to all, Gal.</hi> 8.10. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that they will not always have it, it is winged and flieth away.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I confeſs it may be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (as circumſtances may be) when there is a probability of enjoying ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeaſon to defer it at preſent; but uſually it is beſt to take the preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe future time is uncertain, and then it may be ſaid, <hi>A price was in the hand of a Fool, and he wanted an heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That if it be evident, that more hurt than good will be done by our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent performance of our Duties, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:53132:237"/> and defer them. For thoſe Duties that do not bind us <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> God leaves much to the wiſdom of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian as to the ſeaſon of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That a certain good at preſent muſt be choſen before an uncertain future good, though greater than the former. If I have a price now in my hands to do my ſelf or Neighbour ſome good, and neglect to improve it; but defer it, hoping hereafter for an opportunity of doing my ſelf and Neighbour more good, this is ſinful. I doubt not, but <hi>Felix</hi> ſinned in putting <hi>Paul</hi> off till another ſeaſon, though he had intended to hear him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for his own greater profit, (which he was far enough from) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt know that his own l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e, continuance in his Government, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s life were all at the pleaſure of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not at his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou art upright with God, what is ſaid will be ſufficient; but if out of the deceitfulneſs of thy heart, thy plea be only a pretence for the total omiſſion of thy Duty; know aſſuredly, that if thou canſt find no ſeaſon to do
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53132:238"/> God Service, he will find no ſeaſon for thy Salvation.</p>

               <p n="3">3. A Third excuſe which men have for ſins of Omiſſion, is, It is but one Duty I omit, and I hope there is no ſuch great danger in that. Though I do not read the Word, yet I pray; though I examine not my own heart, yet I read Scripture, and mind prayer; It is true, I give not to the poor, but I am painful in my Calling, and provident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Surely, God who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our weak, infirm, nay, wicked and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>praved natures cannot exſpect univerſal Obedience to his poſitive or negative Commands. He underſtands that Perfection is impoſſible to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature ſince the Fall; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:53132:238"/> ſent his Son into the World, to take away the ſins of it.</p>
               <p>To cure the diſtemper of the brain; for it's a kind of phrenſie which makes men argue after this rate; conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy being guilty of many ſins, and allowing thy ſelf in one ſin. Grace may conſiſt with the being of many ſins in the ſame ſubject, but not with the liking of one ſin. As the love of money is the root of all evil, ſo is the love of Sin the root of all the evil that befals the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He who knew he could not hinder the inherency of many ſins, yet deſires and endeavours to prevent the regency of any one Sin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.132. <hi>Order my ſteps by thy Word, and let not any ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have dominion over me.</hi> Oſerve, not any iniquity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that the Omiſſion of one Duty may ſend thee to Hell, as well as the Omiſſion of many Duties. One Knife, one Sword, one Bullet, one blow may kill a man as well as a thouſand. If thou alloweſt thy ſelf in one Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou art a Servant to this one Sin, (<hi>For his Servant thou art whom thou obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:53132:239"/> Rom.</hi> 6.16.) and ſo the Devils Slave, (for he hath thee as faſt by this one Chain, as by many,) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an Enemy and Rebel againſt God, and accordingly ſhalt ſuffer eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Thy Soul, Friend, is the price of every ſin, and when thou alloweſt thy ſelf in any one, thou doſt implicitly, though not expreſly, bargain with the Devil thy Maſter, to ſell him thy Soul for the wages of unrighteouſneſs, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.20. One man in Law may keep poſſeſſion, and keep the right owner out of his Eſtate. One ſin may keep poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion for Satan, and hinder Jeſus Chriſt from his Right; I mean from ſitting on the Throne, and ſwaying the Scepter of thy Soul. Wallowing in one puddle defiles the Body, and tumbling in one piece of filthineſs defiles the Soul. One piece of ward-Land, though but a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Acre, makes a man liable to the King, and brings in his whole Eſtate, though he be worth thouſands <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> Therefore, Friend, do not ſay, it is but one ſin, and I may be bold with it; but rather, it is Sin, and ſo mortal, and I may not allow it. As Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:53132:239"/> to redeem thee from all iniquity, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. So do thou give thy ſelf to him in all manner of Duty. How ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely have ſome been puniſhed for one Sin. <hi>Moſes,</hi> for not ſanctifying the Name of God at one time. <hi>Eli,</hi> for omitting to reprehend his Children, according to their wickedneſs, which was one Sin. <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons, for not fetching their fire from the Altar (as ſome judge) were ſtruck dead, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1, 2. If the Righteous be recompenced on the Earth, much more the Tranſgreſſor and the Sinner. Take heed, if <hi>Saul</hi>'s ſparing one <hi>Agag,</hi> loſt him his temporal, thy ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one Sin, loſe thee not the eternal Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This one Sin will not go alone; thou mayſt hope when thou haſt opened the door for this one Sin to enter, that thou canſt preſently ſhut, and keep out its aſſociates, but it is impoſſible. Sins are ſociable, and ever go in company. Firſt, one evil Spirit takes poſſeſſion of the man, and then ſeven more worſe than himſelf. As there is a concatenation of Graces, where one goeth all the reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8. ſo there is a
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53132:240"/> concatenation of Sins, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5. They are ſo linkt one in another, that as in a Chain, the drawing of one link brings with that a ſecond, and that a third, and that a fourth, and all are drawn to the very end of the Chain. When <hi>Dalilah</hi> had enticed and prevailed with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> then come the Lords of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and bind him, and put out his eyes, and ſet him to grind at the Mill, and to make them ſport. When one ſin by its flatteries hath deceived and poſſeſſed thy Soul, then come others more potent and lordly to ſtrengthen Satans hold, and make way for others. Any one ſin allowed is a great-bellied Monſter, who hath a numerous brood in the Womb of it. It doth inſenſibly harden the heart, and ſtrongly diſpoſeth it for other Sins; as one wedge makes way for another. Who could have thought that <hi>David</hi>'s idleneſs ſhould be accompanied with ſo great and curſed a crew.</p>
               <p>He who neglects Morning-Prayer, is hereby diſpoſed to neglect God in his Calling, and to buy and ſell, and do all without his counſel. Conſider,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:53132:240"/> Friend, if thou fall from the top of a Ladder but one round, it will be many to one if thou ſtop before thou comeſt to the bottom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This one ſin allowed makes thee guilty of all ſins. By the breach of one Command thou diſowneſt the Authority by which all the Commands are enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> It's true, he doth not break the whole formally; he may be no Thief, no Murderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He breaks the whole Law interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively. He ſlights and deſpiſeth the Author of the whole Law. He cannot obey God in any Command, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours not to obey him in every Command; the Apoſtle ſubjoyns this reaſon, for he that ſaid, <hi>Do not commit Adultery,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Do not kill;</hi> ſo that if thou commit not Adultery, yet if thou killeſt, thou art a Tranſgreſſor of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He breaks the whole Law collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though not diſtributively. All the Commands are ten words, but one Law. The whole Law is one Copulative or
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:53132:241"/> Chain, break one link, you diſorder and mar all. The whole Body ſuffers by a wound given to any one part. The Commands are conſider'd all together, (not ſeverally) as they make one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and perfect rule of righteouſneſs, from which whoſoever ſwerveth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of any part of it, muſt needs ſwerve from the whole.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He breaks the whole Law eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, though not intentionally, in the conſequent of his Diſobedience to one Command. He is liable to the ſame Curſe with thoſe that break every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. He is as truly out of favour with God, as if he had kept never a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Any one condition not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, forfeits the whole Leaſe, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo large; and any one Command not obeyed, forfeits the benefits of the Goſpel, and ſubjects the Soul to eternal damnation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He breaks the whole Law habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, though not actually. The ſame wicked nature which carrieth him out to break one Command wilfully, would carry him out to break them all, if it were not reſtrained. This mans heart
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:53132:241"/> breaks every Command, though his hands be tied, and he is hindred from breaking many of the Commands.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He breaks the whole Law by the breach of any one, becauſe he ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt love, and breaks that bond and knot which keeps and faſtens the whole Law together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Qui uno peccavit omnium reus eſt, peccans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra charitatem, in qua omnia pendent,</hi> Aug. Epiſt. 29. He that breaks one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is guilty of all, becauſe he ſins againſt Charity, on which all hang, ſaith <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Therefore upon the breach of one, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Sabbath, God chargeth the <hi>Jews</hi> with the guilt of all, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.18.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I anſwer, if it be but one ſin thou liveſt in, but one Duty thou liveſt in the omiſſion of, the more fooliſh art thou to loſe all for lack of doing one thing more. Though as the young man ſaid, thou haſt kept all the Commands from thy youth, yet if, as Chriſt ſaid to him, thou lackeſt one thing, truly, as with him, the lack of this one thing will be the loſs of all. And what a Fool is he who runs for a Crown, an incorruptible Crown,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:53132:242"/> to run within one ſtep of the Goal, and then to make a ſtop, and thereby to loſe the prize? Is not he an unwiſe man, who layeth a large Foundation, raiſeth up ſtately Floors, is at great coſt in building an Houſe; yet for want of a little more charge about ſome material pillar of the Edifice, ſuffers it all to fall down?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Conſider it, the omiſſion of one Duty is the amiſſion of all thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If God loſe but one, thou loſeſt all. And art thou willing to loſe all thy labour, all thy days at <hi>the Labour-in-vain,</hi> and that for want of taking a little more pains, and doing one thing more for thy Soul and Salvation.</p>
               <p>One flaw in a Diamond mars all its beauty and brightneſs. One blot in a writing may ſpoil the whole, and render it inſignificant. One poiſonful Herb renders all the good and wholſom Herbs in the pot unprofitable. Therefore do not ſay, It is but one, therefore I may omit it; but rather, it is but one Duty more to all my other Duties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not ſtick at it.</p>

               <p n="5">5. ANother cauſe of ſins of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the example of others. Men are much led by the eye, more than by the ear, and look rather to what their Neighbours do, than to what God ſpeaketh. Though all men are not of one mind in all things, yet moſt in the places where we live are of a mind about evil, and againſt good. The whole City of <hi>Sodom</hi> will joyn together in a ſin that was againſt the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Cities about them, ſinned in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Diſeaſes of others Souls are far more infectious than the Plague, or any other Diſeaſe of their Bodies. The ground why ſeveral neglect the Duties God requireth, is, becauſe others neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them. They ſee their Neighbours (ſome of whom are counted (poſſibly) wiſe men, and are (it may be) rich men and great men, and others who are
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:53132:243"/> numerous,) to live without God, to omit Prayer and Scripture in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to neglect the inſtruction of their Children and Servants, and they think they may omit them as ſafely as others. Nay, they will tell us, ſuch and ſuch men are ſober men, and underſtand themſelves well enough, and they think it needleſs to make ſo much ado about Family-Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the ſanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and our Neighbours general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are of their mind; and why ſhould we be wiſer than our Neighbours? O what a ready Scholar is man to learn a wicked Leſſon that is ſet him by others! If <hi>Corah</hi> conſpire againſt God, he ſhall quickly have ſome hundreds to joyn with him in his rebellion.

               <p>The patterns of them who are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality and Eſtate, have a ſtrange prevalency upon the inferior ſort, and are often the Looking-glaſſes by which they dreſs themſelves. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary men look on their Superiors, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:53132:243"/> if they be not ſcandalous, as men of wiſdom (whether they be ſuch or no) and fit to guide and govern others, and ſo judge they cannot err much, if they follow their ſteps. The Phariſees plead this for the Omiſſion of the great Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Duty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7:48. <hi>Have any of the Rulers of the Phariſees believed on him?</hi> Will ye be wiſer than they? Do you think that if Faith in this Son of man (as he calls himſelf) were a Duty, they would neglect it; or if he were the true Meſſiah, ſuch underſtanding men as they would not know it?</p>
               <p>One great man, as a great Letter in an Indenture (though it ſignifie no more than another ſmall one) hath many ſmall ones following him. The <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (ſome think) were ſo called from their conforming to <hi>Herod</hi> in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And it's judged the <hi>Melchites,</hi> who lived in the Eaſt, were ſo called from <hi>Melech, i. e.</hi> of the Kings Religion. The works of great men are more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful with the ordinary ſort, than the the Will and Word of the great God. Again, the example of the multitude is very forcible. Men are carried down
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:53132:244"/> with the ſtream both eaſily and ſtrongly. It is as common to do as the moſt do in irreligious, as in natural actions. We think our ſelves in greateſt ſafety, when we are with the moſt numerous Party. To be ſingular, is lookt upon as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and thoſe who are ſo, are counted proud, conceited, preciſians. Men chooſe rather to be ſociable in ſin, than ſingular in ſanctity, and to do as the moſt do, than as the beſt do. The few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt's Followers was a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block to his Enemies, and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to his Friends.</p>
               <p>To cure this, <hi>Reader,</hi> conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no patterns of any men are valid againſt the Precepts of God. The Precepts of God are like himſelf, of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain purity and eternal verity; but the patterns of men are like themſelves, vain and variable. Our buſineſs is not to look to what men do, but to what God ſpeaketh. It is highly derogatory to the ſupream Being to make the examples of men, and not his Commands the rule of our lives. The examples of Murderers, Thieves, Drunkards, Swearers, are of as much force againſt the good and
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:53132:244"/> wholſome Law of a Prince, as the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious examples of any men are againſt the holy and righteous Laws of God. A Judge would deride the Malefactors Plea, that ſhould ſay, It is true, I have broke the Kings Laws, but have done no more than ſuch an Eſquire, or Knight, or Lord; I have but imitated them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Or that ſhould ſay, I was guilty of ſuch Treaſons, but I joyn'd with many other Traytors; I had good ſtore of company with me. And doſt thou think, <hi>Reader,</hi> the Judge of Quick and Dead, when he ſhall arraign thee for thine unchangeable Eſtate, and demand of thee why thou omittedſt the Duties he enjoyn'd thee, will accept thy Plea, when thou ſhalt ſay, It is true, Lord, I did live without Scripture, or Prayer in my Family; but ſuch and ſuch great men, who lived near me, did ſo as well as I; I wrot after their Copies, and thought it would be well enough to do as they did; or when thou ſhalt ſay, Lord, though I neglected thy Worſhip and Service, I followed therein almoſt all the Town and Pariſh where I lived, and I judged it beſt to imitate the moſt.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:53132:245"/> Canſt thou imagine that ſuch a ſilly ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple excuſe will bear any weight? Thou wilt not take ſuch a pitiful Plea from any Child or Servant in thy Family. If thy Child, when reproved by thee for Drunkenneſs, or Thieving, or Diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Commands, ſhould excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſay, Sir, other mens Sons are as bad as I, ſuch a Gentleman's Sons are worſe; the Children of very many meet and joyn with me in all my drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtealing, and debauched courſes. How ill would ſuch an anſwer ſound in thine ears? Or what wouldſt thou think, if thy Servant, inſtead of doing the work appointed him, ſhould run from Ale-houſe to Ale-houſe, and ſpend his time in Carding and Dicing, and then excuſe it to thee, that he did as others did; there were many beſide himſelf, and ſome of Quality, who were exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to him. Conſider how poor, how pitiful, how irrational a Plea it is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thy Diſobedience to God, by thy imitation of irreligious men; and do not think that the great God will take that excuſe from thee which thou wilt not from a Child or Servant. Surely
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:53132:245"/> there is a little more difference between the boundleſs bleſſed God, and thee a poor Worm, than there is between thee and any Son or Servant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, If thou wilt follow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (be they great or many) in ſin, thou ſhalt alſo follow them in intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternal Sufferings. <hi>The ways of ſuch tend to death, and their ſteps take hold of Hell.</hi> And if thou wilt walk in their ways, and tread in their ſteps, thou canſt not avoid their end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Come out from among her my people, and be not partakers of her Sins, that ye receive not her Plagues.</hi> He that catcheth the Plague of another, catcheth all the pain and weakneſs, and ill effects of ſuch a Diſeaſe. Do not think to feed on wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mens Dainties, to live their lazy ſenſual lives, and not to pay their reckoning. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Cities about them, went a whoring after ſtrange Fleſh; here they joyn in ſinning, but are they ſeparated in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: truly no: <hi>Are ſet forth for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire, Jude, verſ.</hi> 7. If they unite in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:53132:246"/> they ſhall be united in woe. God will bind them up together as Tares for the fire.</p>
               <p>I know, <hi>Reader,</hi> thou wouldſt not be willing to dwell for ever with, and fare for ever as wicked great men ſhall. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is prepared of old: for the King it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much, wood: the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone, doth kindle it,</hi> Iſa. 30. ult. And why then wilt thou do as they do, and reſemble them now in time. It is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable. Live as they do here, and live as they do for ever. Again, thou art unqueſtionably loth to be with, and ſuffer as the moſt ſhall to eternity. <hi>At the great day the World, (i. e.</hi> the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of it,) <hi>ſhall be condemned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. When they ſhall be arraigned for their endleſs Eſtates, they ſhall be caſt and condemned to the company, and curſes, and torments of the Devils for ever and ever; and if thou wouldſt not die their Deaths, or partake of their unchangeable Conditions, why wilt thou live their lives, and walk in their wicked ways.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="673" facs="tcp:53132:246"/>3. Conſider of all patterns, theſe two, The greateſt or richeſt, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, are moſt unfit for thy imitation. Becauſe of all men, theſe uſually are the worſt men, and do leaſt imitate Chriſt. For great men, how few are there who are good; Grace and Greatneſs are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and lovely, but rare Conjunctions. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>That Wiſdom is good with an Inheritance,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.11. But where ſhall we find Wiſdom and Wealth, Righteouſneſs and Riches together. Great and rich men have their Farms and Merchandizing, and Honours and Pleaſures, and other things to look after than their Souls and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>How hardly,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſhall a rich man enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> It may well be hard for him, who turns the cords of Love, and bands of Kindneſs into fewel, to his luſts and weapons of unrighteouſneſs. Bleſſed be God there are ſome great men who walk religiouſly, but truly they are very few. <hi>Brethren, ye know your calling, not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:53132:247"/> World,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27, Not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe, or mighty, or noble are choſen or called of God. <hi>But God hath choſen the poor of the World rich in Faith, and Heirs of a Kingdom,</hi> James 2.5. The poor are evangelized, transformed into the heavenly ſpiritual Nature of the Goſpel. The Poor receive the Goſpel, the Rich receive the World, and the things of the World. The Poor having little Eſtate in the World, look after an Eſtate in the Covenant; but the Rich having this Worlds Goods, are ſatisfied, and deſire no more. Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> wilt thou follow them that are wholly taken up with fleſhly fading Pleaſures and Riches, and caſt off all care of their eternal condition? Are they fit to be thy Guides, who bid defiance to God, and fight againſt him with his own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and throw off all regard and care what ſhall become of them for ever and ever?</p>
               <p>Again, for the giddy-headed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, how unfit are they to be thy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Moſt are uſually the worſt. Of all Creatures, the baſeſt and vileſt are ever moſt numerous, as Flies and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:53132:247"/> How few Jewels to Pebbles or common ſtones. The weaker part are more than the wiſer. <hi>The whole World lieth in wickedneſs,</hi> as a brute in his filth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. and are ſuch fit to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? <hi>The whole Earth wandreth after the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 17. <hi>and is deceived by the Devil,</hi> Rev. 12.9. And are ſuch poor tame Slaves to a cruel Devil, who hates them and thee perfectly, good examples for thee to imitate? Doſt thou not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what truth ſpeaketh, <hi>Broad is the way, and wide is the gate that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be who go therein,</hi> Matth. 7.14. Stop a little, and ponder it. Wilt thou go after them, who go in the broad way to deſtruction?</p>
